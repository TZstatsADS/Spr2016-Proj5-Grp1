Steven	Feiner	9/29/2005	2	2	1		"This professor obviously has total disdain for his students (all but PHds). He make disparaging remarks about some students that might not get the material instantly, is poorly prepared for lectures, and shows no interest in them. Many later assignments in the semester are mostly unsolvable and this from a student that did well in his classes."	-1			
Steven	Feiner	7/13/2007	3	3	1		I took me 3 tries of doing poorly on his tests to figure out how best to study for his exams: you need to memorize alot! 4 try and I got it. Projects are very demanding.	0

John	Kender	1/25/2010	5	5	3		He is a very mentoring and attentive advisor. He devotes at least one hour of personal meeting time each week with each grad. student and schedules more time if necessary.	3			
John	Kender	12/17/2013	5	5	3	A+	"An excellent professor, perhaps even the best in the CS department. Take his classes!"	3			
John	Kender	4/11/2015	1	3	2	Rather not say	Class subject itself is interesting. Topics included various methods of developing visual interfaces including biometrics. But you won't learn how to actually implement them. That you have to figure out yourself when you do projects on your own. Be careful - Kender has sent multiple students to Dean's Discipline for supposed 'cheating allegations'.	-4	TOUGH GRADER	SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS.	
Jason	Nieh	10/22/2003	4	5	2		"Great teacher, great course. Extremely clear about why things are how they are. Challenges the students to think through the answer instead of just stating it, which too few professors in CS do."	0			
Jason	Nieh	2/6/2004	4	5	1		Great prof and great course. Good combination of theory and practice. Be prepared to sleep in the lab and hope that your TA didn't have a bad day;)	0			
Jason	Nieh	4/3/2005	3	5	2		Effective teacher with a sense of humor. Exams and homeworks are challenging but instructive.	0

Luis	Gravano	10/10/2004	3	5	4		Excellent professor! Very clear in lectures and found problem sets doable yet challanging.	0			
Luis	Gravano	3/11/2005	5	5	3		"Cutie!!! Interesting projects, but a bit too much sometimes."	0			
Luis	Gravano	7/17/2005	5	4	3		One of the best professors I've ever had. Both as an undergrad and a graduate. There are not many professors as good and helpful as Professor Gravano in any university I've attended.	0			
Luis	Gravano	4/29/2009	5	5	1		"One of the best professors I ever had. He was engaged, prepared and seemed to care about teaching. He was quick to respond to emails and provide feedback. He also has a great sense of humor which made sitting through some dull material a little better."	0			
Luis	Gravano	10/14/2011	5	4	4		He is the best professor I ever had!!	-1

Gail	Kaiser	9/29/2005	5	5	4		Class was interesting and there was a lot of freedom with the project. TAs were not as helpful as the prof.	0

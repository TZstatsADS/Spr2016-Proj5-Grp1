The lecture slides were unhelpful at best, and he basically just reads off of them during lecture with some supplementary doodling on the blackboard.  Still, he's a nice guy who will be happy to explain stuff in office hours, but I found the books to be the most helpful, especially for the homeworks.  As for the course, be ready for A LOT of stat and linear algebra before you get to the good stuff.","Four cookbook homework assignments using MATLAB (start early), a moderately difficult midterm, a virtually impossible final, and an open-ended project/paper.

While I do not rate him as the best guy in the department, he is not as bad as the other two reviews suggest. Machine Learning is a specialized field, unlike other core cs courses, it is interdisciplinary. It does need a good background in Linear Algebra, Calculus and a bit of statistics. WIth the right background, if the course is taken, the course is really enjoyable. Some of his slides are really good (again if you have the right background needed). Compared to Machine Learning home works given at other schools by other professors, his home works really make you understand what you implement. Overall I would give an A- for his course.

The main problem is that he tries to fit way too much information into slides and is so boring that you stop caring about the course. He also interlaces examples while introducing examples, which may seem like a good idea, but Prof. Jebara introduces them at such bad times that you don't learn anything. 
Also, the homework is embarrassingly easy and you don't learn anything, so by the time exams roll around, you don't have a clue what happened in the class.

Before people spout off bullshit about how machine learning is hard, try to find a lecture about ML by Andrew Ng (Stanford), Michael Jordan (Berkeley), or Tommi Jaakkola (MIT), or for a different flavor Carlos Guestrin (CMU). All the classes they teach cover more material, but the students are able to understand more material and understand it better.","Two bad exams, 6 joke homeworks","7","Machine Learning","COMS W4771"
"5","1921","Sun, 16 May 2010 00:02:00 GMT","24411","1636","There's a lot of debate on the background required to take/enjoy this course. Let me give you mine: Linear algebra (important, forgot), Gradients/Hessian (slightly important, forgot), diff/integ of exp, log, poly (important, very good), Probability (most important, Very good), Statistics (not needed, forgot), Optimization (slightly important, none), MATLAB (most important, none). Do not let people intimidate you, you can still do very well in this course by honest effort. Besides Prof. Jebara is a very good and considerate teacher who buffers his lectures with essential background material. 

I'm puzzled with the other reviewer's comments regarding the material with respect to Ng et al. The combination of topics such as SVMs, VC Dim, graphical models and Back propagation is rare. Digging deeper, 6.867 at MIT is very similar in scope.

His slides are a work of art! Beautifully thought out with rich visual cues.

TAs were brilliant (Pier Francesco Palamara and David Bondatti). Patient, welcoming and knew the material inside out.","Very well designed assignments. These involve translating/extending the equations in class to new distributions and settings and implementing them in MATLAB for a non-trivial data set. I feel very happy doing them because I know I will know EM, Junction Tree etc. inside out rather than wrestling some artificially hard time drain. Exams are challenging but fun!

I am sure the professor is a genius in his field, but it was not well executed or translated to undergrads.  The lectures were dry at best - the class was not engaged.  The lectures were very repetitive - you realy only needed to go to every other class as he spend the first half reviewing and the second half teaching (though I did go to every class).  The slides were confusing with too much information crammed into them.

The teacher was not very approachable - I went to his office hours but he was unable to explain the proof in question to me.

Much of the course was over my head, in part because the prerequisites did not prepare me.  Iw as not alone in this, but the course was not taught with this in mind.

The TA's were horrendous at best.  The did NOT understand teh material.  I would usually start the homework the day it was assigned - if I went to office hours then I was told I was working too early and they were not yet expected to understand the homework.  I was also very annoyed when, after a homework had been live for a week (and I had completed it) it was changed.","Exams were impossible - no idea where he got the concepts from

"7","1921","Thu, 12 May 2011 03:43:43 GMT","25956","1636","This is a very difficult course made much worse by the fact that he simply can't teach.  From what I understand he is very good in his field, but that does not translate into the classroom.

The lectures are confusing and the slides are difficult to understand.  He spends slide after slide on the easiest parts and then glosses over the more difficult concepts because they're ""obvious"".  I and a lot of other students in the class didn't bother to use our notes and materials from his lectures to prepare, instead using the freely available materials for the Stanford machine learning course.  It's absurd how much better they are.

Jebara isn't very approachable.  If you look at his personal web page he has about ten different places where he says he's busy and can't be bothered.  The TA's are hit and miss - there are one or two that are good and will actually try to help, but the rest aren't that great.  I'm pretty sure one of them never actually held office hours.  He just sent out an email that he was canceling every week.

Also, there was a really strange incident that stuck out at me: on one of the homeworks one of the TA's announced they thought there was a lot of cheating going on, as they got a lot of almost identical submissions (something like 40 out of 130ish students), and their response to this was to take a few points off the grade of any student with one of those suspicious homeworks who asked for a regrade.  It just falls in with the fact that, as a general rule, the professor and TA's for this class just can't be bothered.","5 deceptively difficult homework assignments - they seem simple, but you have to look up a lot of math
1 unholy difficult midterm - I thought I was pretty prepared, but there were a lot of hard concepts combined, along with the requirement of doing a lot of big matrix operations we'd been doing in matlab by hand.

"8","1921","Sat, 14 May 2011 14:30:43 GMT","25999","1636","Warning: this class should be an applied math course. I attended lecture frequently but learned nearly nothing, and the slides were incomprehensible. He assumed a level of math that was not reflected in the prerequisites whatsoever, but at the same time, he oversimplified some things to the point of being confusing: he explained what an integral was but then, a few lectures later, used Lagrange multipliers without a single word of explanation. The homeworks were nigh impossible, and the midterm was about tangential mathematical properties of the equations that we based algorithms off of. This course is by far the worst grade I've gotten at Columbia, despite the effort I put in.","Five homeworks that take around 6 to 10 hours each.","7","Machine Learning","COMS W4771"

Unfortunately, the class was enormous with about 200 people and the lectures took a hit.  The instructor had no clue where most of the class was, and questions were rare. The lecture slides and lectures assumed reading ahead of time, and half of the class seemed to be behind. I got an A+ and I didn't do anything special other than read ahead in the book. The class doesn't lost as prerequisites but should MATLAB, optimization (Lagrangians, subgradient and gradient methods, etc.), graduate probability ( measure spaces, Bayes, and conditional/causal reasoning, etc.), lots and lots of linear algebra, and differential equations. It felt like he was trying to fit an entire career of ML into one semester.  

Some I sat next to in class were from basketweaving departments like OR or Business.  This is definitely a math or statistics class. ","Five very challenging homeworks. They would have taken much longer, but the answers were all online from previous years.","7","Machine Learning","COMS W4771"

I think the prerequisites are enough to prepare you for the math covered in the material; you will have the opportunity to explore more of differentials applied to matrices, lagrangian and bayesian probability. 
For me it was pain attending lectures as I could hardly follow him. I guess his lectures were hampered by the size of the class. He would always seem to be in a hurry to cover as much material as he could without really caring whether students understand any of it or not. Like many others, I had to rely on online lectures from Stanford to build a proper understanding of many concepts covered in the class. What a shame! 
Assignments do well in helping you get the feel of the concepts but are not substantial enough to endow confidence to tackle hard problems. Mid-term was a disaster. Final exam was good, I thought.
","Five assignments, a midterm and a final exam. Assignments have programming (in matlab) and non-programming (math) problems.

"11","1921","Sat, 26 Jan 2013 13:01:23 GMT","28050","1636","Top 5 (out of 1,024) reasons to avoid this course at all costs:

1. No matter how much Prob/Stats or Linear Algebra or just MATH in general you *think* you know, you're not ready for this course (especially if you're an undergrad.. if you're a superstar Ph.D student, make your own judgement).  For example, on one of the homeworks, we were asked to perform vector calculus, which is usually not covered in any of the prerequisites. Another example is when we were asked to do multiple indefinite integrals of a particularly long formula, by hand, during a midterm as a problem worth 20% of the grade.

2. He goes through very few examples in class, (and when he does, only a select few understand him) which means that most of the homework problems you have absolutely no idea how to do, even if you took the best notes humanly possible in his incredibly dull lectures. For this reason, academic honesty in its strictest definition (no looking through internet for answers, no collaboration on homeworks) is nowhere to be found, because it is impossible to do 90% of the workload in this class otherwise.

3. He can't teach. I will leave it at this because no other words can describe how truly bad he is.

4. Since this isn't an absolute requirement for any tracks (even for AI, you can take much better courses such as Spoken Language Processing), you can do yourself a favor and take this same course on Coursera or other excellent online alternatives if you would really like to learn Machine Learning. This is more ideal since Jebara's class is the least efficient place to do any learning.

5. http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~jebara/ Look at his picture. He is smiling smugly at the pains you will have to go through to survive in his course.","5 Homeworks (5-20 hours of RESEARCH, because you ain't solving these with what you ""learned"" in class)

There are not many graduate classes at Columbia where you feel you have learnt your money's worth. Trust me, this is one class where you will feel challenged and inspired. Prof. Jebara is good with giving intuitions about many things, picking examples from Vision, Genomics, NLP. You many find this course ""hard"", or ""uninteresting"", if you thought ML is ""cool"", or the sole image of Machine Learning in your head is from ML class by Andrew Ng on Coursera. This is a very maths based course, and he mentions this in the first class, and urges people to drop if they can't handle it. I guess it is fair on his part, to announce that the maths will be slighty tough, I wouldn't say even tough, just different. This course will help you a lot, if you want to read Machine Learning papers, do research in the field, because there is some very odd notation involved and the course will teach you that. My vote is take this course, if you are ready to dive into hour long lectures of Mathematical Proofs, but if you are upto it, this will be a great course.","5 Assignments : Assignments are actually easy, programing ones might take time depending on how familiar you are with matlab

"14","1921","Thu, 22 May 2014 00:32:05 GMT","29522","4057","Prof. Pe'er is really well-intentioned, and it's clear that he cares a lot about his students. I took a lot away from this class, even though it was a struggle. That said, DO NOT take this class if you're not remotely interested in machine learning - it's _not_ worth it. There are several other breadth/AI track courses that are (possibly) more interesting. If you _are_ interested in the subject, however, I'd definitely recommend taking this class with him instead of with Prof. Jebara. 

1) Teaching: If you have trouble staying awake in classes where professors speak really slowly/if you've ever been in one of the Mudd classrooms and know how boring they are, BRING COFFEE/TEA/anything that keeps you awake. Prof. Pe'er speaks really slowly, so much so that when you play his lectures at 1.5x speeds (they're all on CVN, which is great), it sounds like most people speaking at a normal pace. 
2) The material: While the class is very math-heavy (as are most courses on machine learning), Prof. Pe'er is very generous with his use of examples to provide better intuitions for the concepts/algorithms covered, and even tries to do live demonstrations to help make the math clearer. Some lectures and topics have a very steep learning curve even if you have the prerequisites covered, but I learned a tremendous amount from this class and I don't think I would have gotten that much from Prof. Jebara's far more theoretical approach. 
3) Homework: The homework is time consuming, not because each individual assignment is long, but because there are assignments EVERY WEEK. The assignments are hard, so starting in advance is essential (which means you're usually working on ML assignments 4 days a week at least), and responses on Piazza from the TAs are erratic and come in waves, so they're not reliable. Prof. Pe'er does allow group work with some constraints, so that usually makes working on assignments easier. But START EARLY. The assignments are also usually vaguely worded, which was a pain to deal with.
4) The tests: This was the most confusing part of the class. I think Prof. Pe'er experimented with a lot of testing styles because it was his first time teaching this class. (Either that, or he always throws 4 different testing styles at his students in all his other classes too because he thinks it builds character.) 
- Quizzes: multiple choice, where any number of choices could be true or false, and you lost points for either answering wrong or not answering at all. (So really, you had a 50% chance of getting it right anyway..) The questions on the quiz were theoretical and just requierd you to know the concepts, and some involved doing some basic calculations/inferences.
- Midterm: Easily the best test in this class. It was take-home and entirely programming, with 50% of the grade going towards an explanation of your approach. I think the grading was pretty fair - you got graded on the performance of your approach for the programming part, and the quality of your approach for the explanation. Very straightforward and doable in the 4 day timeframe given.
- Final: This came out of nowhere - the questions on the final ranged from proofs to algorithm creation to calculations - basically a very, very difficult exam. He gave us a practice final that, as it turned out, exactly resembled the actual final, but it still gave us no way to prepare, given that all the testing methods we'd had before were so different. It was almost impossibly long (though challenging and very interesting, required you to actually apply knowledge to real-world problems).

5) The curve: VERY generous curve. Another reason to definitely take this class with him and not Prof. Jebara. I think he really recognizes how hard he makes the class (in terms of workload, learning curve, difficulty of final) and curves to a high-ish B+. A large percentage of the class got A-range grades. 

Again, this is a professor who really cares about his students and the effort they put in, and isn't just looking to make this class frustrating and impossible. In general, he's very very responsive to feedback, even takes reasonable requests for class-wide extensions, and always tries really hard to make sure ever single student understands. I haven't had many 4000-level classes where that's the case, so this was refreshing. The class is still extremely frustrating, but ultimately rewarding if you like the material and put a lot of effort into the work.","Homework: 10 assignments (1 really simple setup assignment which includes a small Matlab script), 1 per week, all in Matlab  (25%)
Midterm: Programming with an explanation of approach (25%)

pros :-
1. The prof was very approachable and cared for his class.
2. He atleast tried to make sure that everyone gets the concepts right.

However, our class was very unfortunate to have been taught by Professor Pe'er. He is by far the worst professor I've ever had in my academic experience. To add insult to injury, he is very unapologetic about the way he manages things and treats his students unfairly. 

Assignments:
Every assignment included grammatical errors and unintelligible sentences in addition to mistakes in the problem descriptions. As a result, 1-2 day assignment would turn into a week-long affair. Future assignments are also based on answers to previous ones even though the class was not given the solution to the previous assignment. As a result, students who might have had incorrect answers in the previous assignment would unknowingly have errors in the next assignment.

Misinformation:
Professor Pe'er likes to portray himself as a fair individual but time and time again did he prove us wrong. Our first quiz was multiple choice test where correct answers were given 3 points and incorrect negative 2. However, the class was not told that leaving answers blank would result in negative marks too. Another example of this kind of behavior was demonstrated when he ran a poll to decide whether assignments should be due on a Friday or Wednesday. >80% of students who voted, voted for Friday yet the Professor appeared to have conveniently forgotten to tell the class that over 60% of the entire class needed to participate in the poll for it to be deemed valid. Something he decided to tell us after the fact. 

Sadly there are many more examples of this kind of behavior which is simply unprofessional. 

I can't speak to how Prof Jebara might teach this class and whether it's any better. But my main advice would be to stay away from Prof Pe'er, simply because you'll waste more time clearing up any confusions than being able to dedicate time to the actual subject.

Cons:
The worst classroom delivery I have ever seen in my entire life including school anywhere. Machine learning is no doubt fascinating but does require some foundation, but his classroom delivery is some of the worst I have ever seen, stammering, stuttering, is ok for CS 101, in a community college but totally unacceptable for a graduate level course in such a esteemed institution where the pay for professors is high and the fees are exorbitant.

On top of his inaudible and cringe inducing voice the material is complex but no doubt interesting. Professor needs to desperately address this and take a look at videos of himself on how to improve for future classes or otherwise just stay a researcher and not lecture.

Just look at the how well Andrew Ng did his course in Coursera on Machine Learning.

Because of the above it felt a waste of the money we spend on course here. I think Jebara would be much better, understandable and you would feel your moneys worth.

The course revolves around the idea of teaching a computer to extract information from visual images, such as the position of an object, the position of edges, shape/depth of a scene from multiple images. Some of it will make you rethink the many things we as humans take for granted, and Shree likes to insert pertinent biological/philosophical/tech-biz tidbits that encourage an appreciation for the material beyond a purely CS perspective. The underlying theory could potentially get very mathematical, but Shree avoids that and focuses instead on the general ideas and principles. In sum, the subject material is interesting, challenging at times but rarely impossible.  As a teacher, Shree is one of the best out there. He is entertaining, funny, and very dedicated to making sure we learn. He is also a very effective lecturer with excellent presentation.

He provides the class with handouts containing almost every slide he uses (yes, he uses slides on a projector, which is usually a bad sign, but he pulls it off well)... over 400 pages per student across the term.  This minimizes how much you have to take down in terms of notes, and allows you to spend more of the lecture making sure you understand, rather than copying down diagrams.
I have to agree with the previous review: Professor Nayar's digressions are always interesting, and regardless of whether they help understand the material, they help understand the motivations, or how vision works in humans.
It's not an easy class, but if you come to lecture all the time and pay attention, you shouldn't have trouble with the homeworks... 
the midterm and final may be a different matter though.  However, the professor and TAs are very helpful in office hours.","The homeworks aren't so bad... 5 or 6 of them, and I found that the programming actually got easier as the term went on (after the third homework).

The only thing that was a little weird about the vision class was the lack of math -- it was all in the slides but there is essentially no math in the entire class, which is in sharp contrast to the textbook.  In addition, the first homework is pretty ridiculous in many ways and shouldn't be considered as a measure of the class' overall worth.

Programming assignments are engaging, and exams are very fair.  Prof. Nayar makes use of the entire spectrum of scores on exams, and I feel gives proper questions to let those who understand subjects thoroughly to stand out.

The programs are a lot fun. They take some thinking, but overall they're well-structured and very useful. The theory questions on homeworks are impossible.

What's very unfair about this course though is that you can't recover from a single bad grade on anything (hw, midterm, or final). A single mess-up will glare at you on your final grade, not to mention that the curve is very small. The difference between letter grades is very slight, only a few points will be bump you up from a B+ to an A (notice there's no A-). But only a few points will drop you down from a B+ to a B-.

Unfortunately he grades strictly by the numbers, and no amount of asking questions in class, going to office hours, or demonstrating grade improvement throughout the semester will factor into your final grade. He has no problem setting the average to a low grade.","5 homeworks (they get easier over time)

Professor Nayar is also possibly the best professor in the department. Great lecturing style, clearly super intelligent, and genuinely does his best to make sure we understand the material. That said, we cover a lot of material in this class, and preparing for the exams is hellish. The exams generally cover some of the easier concepts in the class, but it's also easy to lose points on proofs and there are also quite a few questions where you just have to remember a specific detail or some model which you otherwise can't derive on the spot. No way around some of this stuff unless you put a lot of time into memorization of the material.

Homeworks are great! They're done in MATLAB now (I think he said they were in C until a couple years ago), so they're constantly evolving - Nayar admits as much himself, especially that he put a lot more material in the class and on the HWs this semester. This is not a class you want to procrastinate on (nor can you afford to). If you start the night before, you may stay up all night, and just not be able to finish due to the difficulty of some of these homeworks. You should start at least a few days before so you have time to consult the TAs because you will inevitably run into MATLAB bugs, amongst other issues with understanding the Vision algorithms themselves.

You should probably attend every class because Professor Nayar doesn't post any of the material on courseworks. The TAs print out all the lecture slides and you pick up one of these packets at the beginning of each class. These are literally just printouts of the slides, so you'll want to take miscellaneous notes and comments based on what the professor says while presenting each slide.

We didn't receive any information about the distribution of grades this semester, so I can only comment that my grade was definitely lower than expected. A few people have said the same thing about their grades, but we can't make any generalizations. Just know it's a hard class - if you get a low grade, don't worry too much about it because this is one of the best, most useful classes you'll take in the CS@CU department, from one of the best professors around.","5 homeworks (1-3 non-programming, 1-2 programming problems per HW). HW is 50% of your grade. Midterm (15%), Final (35%). Homework could take anywhere from 5 to 40 hours per assignment. Writing the skeleton code for basic functionality doesn't usually take too long if you understand the algorithms/concepts to use, but there are always faster and better ways to implement certain things. Whether it's MATLAB vectorization or clever use of convolutions, you have to think things through pretty well to attain top marks. This takes time, and can cause problems if you're not already familiar with MATLAB syntax and other tricks. ","7","Computer Vision","COMS W4731"
"25","2386","Sun, 08 Jun 2014 06:39:27 GMT","29624","1812","Vision was the most rewarding class by far. Prof. Nayar is funny, smart and makes lectures very interesting. He has an answer to all of your questions. He likes discipline, mind you, but is not that fanatic about it.

You cannot miss any of his lectures as the slides will stare at you when you prepare for the midterm or final. You get printed slides so you just need to take down additional notes (if any).  In Spring 2014, he tried a lot of new material and so the overall workload increased exponentially after midterm. He also took feedback post midterm and in the last class to update the class materials. There were review classes in the lecture before the tests which were quite helpful, if at all you started preparing!

It helps to have a study group as making sense of each slide takes up a lot of time although everything seems like a breeze during the class. TA's were very helpful. Thomas was a little picky in giving points but used to explain important concepts easily. You won't understand where exactly you lost points but they do indicate the relevant challenge number. Though programming in MATLAB seems easy, debugging is a headache. Make sure you proceed step by step. Just a tip: avoid built in functions unless you are completely sure of what they return. Getting a working solution was not enough to secure full points. You need to provide a 'smart' solution.

I was taking Computer Graphics along with it and I must say a lot of my fundamentals got cleared through this class. His 'Math Primer' slides were just mind-boggling. Everything was explained in such an elegant manner. Overall, ""you get a lot for the tuition you pay"" in Prof. Nayar's words!","Heavy. 5 Homeworks (1 Theory, 4 Programming + Theory) + Midterm + Final.

You generally have more than two weeks for each HW. No late days. First assignment had basic MATLAB intro but some challenging theory questions. Second one was the toughest for me and I lost a lot of points since I started just the night before. Rest of the HWs were decent and rewarding provided you start early i.e. the previous weekend or so. You implement a panorama stitcher, refocusing app...how cool is that!

Midterm as well as the final were not tough but there were few challenging questions to identify people who could think a little out of the box. Overall the avg was quite high ~ 20/30 midterm and ~ 35/48 final.","7","Computer Vision","COMS W4731"
"26","2387","Wed, 10 Dec 2003 00:00:00 GMT","7055","47","This is a spectacular class!

It's officially limited to 30, and there's a chance you'll have to compete somewhat for a spot in the class, but that's rare - my class had 23 or so people at the beginning, and ended up at 21 for the bulk of the term.

Unlike most CS classes, Programming & Problem Solving is a discussion-based class.  There are four projects across the term (each covering about 3 weeks).  There are 5 discussion classes per problem (in which the class demos their latest solutions and discusses their approaches), and one class where each group presents their report.
Groups are randomly determined, but you can request to work with particular students (but you can only work with each person on ONE project).  The groundwork for the problem-solving has been done for you - the TA provides the class with a simulator program and the interface for your code to use, so you can dive in and typically write a simple/naive solution to the problem in twenty minutes or so, leaving you most of the project time to create and implement more complex solutions - there is almost no setup work.
The class works on full disclosure and full sharing - you can take any code you find online and use it, as long as you say you did, and you can rip off your classmates as much as you want, as long as you credit them for what you ripped off.
One of the great things about this class is that it brings you into a group of some of the best minds currently studying at the school.  It will have you thinking differently about all sorts of problems.  The other great thing about the class is how I always left the discussions wanting to work on the project - unlike most classes where the assignments are fairly arbitrary, you have a great deal of leeway in the deliverable, and typically you have something you want to try.
I would recomend this class to anybody who feels comfortable with a discussion-
oriented problem-solving case study.

Also, I would reccomend Professor Ross' databases course - he is an excellent professor.","It really varies by both your group and how much work you want to put into the class.  However, the more you put in, the more you get out.  And you'll probably find you want to work more for this class than your other classes.","7","Programming & Problem Solving","COMS W4444"
"27","2387","Mon, 15 Dec 2003 00:00:00 GMT","7129","47","As you can read on CULPA and the SEAS Oracle, students who have taken this course generally have lots of positive things to say about it, most of which are absolutely true.

However, because the course places such a huge emphasis on collaboration and the interchange of ideas,  what you get out of it varies greatly with the competence and creativity of your fellow classmates.  For some reason, Prof. Ross seems convinced that the course ""self-selects"" smart people, that those enrolled in it are naturally highly critical/creative thinkers.  This may have been true for past offerings of this course, but I did not find it to be the case when I took it.

Out of 22 students, maybe 8 regularly produced creative, original ideas and could competently implement them.  Most of the others were pretty average, while a few people were just plain dumb, lazy, or both.  This may sound harsh, but when you find yourself teamed up with one or (gasp) two of these people and have to think through an inventive problem solution, code it, and write the final report all by yourself, you *will* feel your urge to kill rising.  Also bear in mind that all members of a group receive the same grade, and there is no formal peer review process.

I still recommend this course; it has several important merits that others have mentioned, and what you learn in it will stay relevant long after you forget the intricate details of distributed transactions or lambda calculus.  If you put in the work, you will walk away content unless, like me, you don't suffer fools gladly.  If you don't put in the work, you will still do relatively well at the expense of those who do.","Up to you.

Swing interfaces are key parts of every assignment involving Java after Data Structures.  Furthermore, copying code to create the data structures is fine - it's a matter of using them - why do you think the class is considered a difficult one for many?  Because they don't know how to copy properly?

But I digress.  Robotics is Allen's specialty, and he clearly shows he knows what he's talking about.  The class has some rather cool aspects about it, including the use of a robot simulator.  You actually apply concepts from linear algebra to something.  Furthermore, it gives a solid background to what kinds of projects are going on in robotics.  Some of it is basic at first, but it gets better as it progresses.","The workload is fair and requires a bit of time, but most written assignments can be done in a night.

The contrast could not have been clearer -- while Rocco is a clear and competent lecturer who is quick on his feet and always able to answer questions, Allen is a bumbling, incompetent waste of time. He was never once able to answer any questions posed to him in a way that suggested he understood either the question or even the material. His lectures were disorganized, rambling, and unintuitive. He is far and away the worst professor I have ever had at Columbia Computer Science (and perhaps tied for worst ever at Columbia). ","Not too bad.

"30","2403","Mon, 14 Apr 2014 04:56:30 GMT","29326","37","The homeworks are relatively easy, the projects are ""fun"" (in that nerdy way that CS kids love), the classes are not really necessary to go to after the linear algebra sections have been covered, but the midterm and final are kind of bullshit. Allen only gives you a general overview of what might be on it, without a practice test, and the questions on it are weird; often testing cursory knowledge of subjects not covered in any assignment or project. It felt like the final was ""trying"" to be harder than the rest of the class just to achieve a nice grading curve.

That said, here are the pros:

You get to program for an actual, real-world machine, which is something you don't really get to do in many other classes. It's a different kind of debugging when you have to find out how slippery a certain floor is and factor that into your motion calculations to account for drift. 

You also get to use linear algebra in a very practical way, (It really cemented a lot of the fundamentals I had only weakly grasped after taking intro to Linear Algebra). Lastly, it also serves as an intro to Computer Vision as well, some of the later homework assignments require you to mount a camera on the robot and do image processing to solve certain puzzles.

In summary, it's a class that kind of feels like an easy-A class despite having a respectable work-load (the projects) and arbitrarily difficult exams. Allen is a lenient grader for the projects, but not for the midterms. This is definitely an ""application"" class, not really a ""theory"" class. Take it if programming a Roomba sounds like something you would like to do; for all its flaws I enjoyed it well enough.","Respectable; it's a class with a programming workload, expect to be submitting things at 11:55pm on the night they're due at least once or twice.","7","Computational Aspects of Robotics","COMS W4733"

His is not a hard professor to get a hold of because he constantly checks his e-mails (and replies to any questions one might have) and gives you his cell phone to call if necessary.

"32","2767","Thu, 30 Aug 2012 04:02:49 GMT","27517","2060","A really interesting computer graphics class with an amazing professor. In this class, we are given a glimpse to the realm of geometry modeling and geometry processing. As we live in the age that artists and product designers utilize 3D software such as Rhino or Maya or ZBrush, to digitally model their products before actualization into tangible objects, or to model cartoon characters that would appear in animated films, this class provides a great introduction into the technical aspects of how these 3D softwares work or should work. We study the fundamentals down to the level of so-called NURBS curves and surfaces, geometry processing performed on triangle meshes, and subdivision surfaces -- each with extensive mathematical backgrounds that consider how these structures give artists and manufacturers computational advantages such as desired degree of smoothness no matter what shape of the curves/surfaces are formed. It is a really fun experience to learn how design softwares are actually made of, and we also had a guest speaker from the industry to discuss how he actually uses the software to design real-world products.

So the class covers mainly three parts: the fundamentals of B-Spline curves and surfaces (as well as NURBS and Rational form), geometry processing (in particular, mesh data structures and mesh simplification algorithms), and Subdivision surfaces (e.g., Catmull-Clark). Each topic has extensive assignments associated with it to help us see how things are implemented. Some are really challenging, but Prof. Reed would give us extensions if needed. So we always have time to refine our assignments as possible. I'd say I'm very proud of the code I have done for this class, since they never look like a mess compared to other classes that I sometimes rush things through just to make it work. It's so organized, and beautiful.

Speaking of the professor, he is probably one of the best professors I've had for Computer Science class, personality-wise. He really took time to answer individual emails and discussion threads. He modified his assignments plan as the semester went, so we were given more challenging works since we did well as a class on the first few assignments, which helped me to learn even more. He was very approachable during his office hours or after class. So in a sense, you never feel isolated or helpless in this class. The only caveat is that his lectures sometimes may be a bit dry, but bare with them, and you will go a long way.

So, even with a slight interest in computer graphics in general, I'd recommend you to come and take the class, and you will be amazed how much you learn and have fun at the end.","3 Assignments, each covering main topic in the class, as mentioned above.

Prof. Malkin makes a point of offering both conceptual and formal treatments of the material, which in principle is nice (as just about every result in crypto is deeply counterintuitive); in practice, I found her lemma-proof-theorem teaching very clear, but the high-level explanations so vague as to be practically useless. Part of the issue was that a large portion of the class didn't really have the mathematical maturity necessary for this course, and she would get bogged down answering basic questions and then have to rush through material. She got better at this (i.e. stopped answering stupid questions) as the semester went on, but it remained frustrating throughout.

Homework assignments were well-designed. Fernando (the TA) was a real stickler for rigor, and I definitely learned to be more careful about writing up proofs by the end of the semester. Midterm (in class) and final (take home) were both trivial; I don't know what the final average was, but due to the aforementioned mathematical maturity problem midterm scores were shockingly low.

As a side note, this can be a great class even if you're not specifically interested in security. I was in learning theory at the same time, and my final project for that class relied on a bunch of cryptographic hardness assumptions---this is about a lot more than secret codes.","Light.

If you fit into both categories, you'll breeze through this class; if you're merely good at math but spend no time studying, you can expect to get a B-/B, and if you're not so good at math but really enjoy the subject or spend a shit ton of time studying, you can probably walk out with at least an A-.","6 problem sets and 6 programming projects

His lectures on the conceptual component of Computer Science are useful, though reading the book would give you the same information, but it can be more time consuming since it has a lot of unnecessary information.

His first midterm includes a lot of memorization and not a lot of programming examples. The programming component isn't related to the assignments at all but to the simple principles of object-oriented programming. The other component was mostly memorization.

The homework assignments are not extremely difficult, but do take time and actual mastery of the subject. He makes himself very available if you need help, and has knowledge of Computer Science that extends far beyond Java. The workload is not serious, and you do not really need to attend lecture if you're keeping up with the book.

I would recommend this course to any strong student up for a challenge, even one who does not need COMS as a requirement.  Professor Cannon says it is not easy and tells us which assignments are especially hard, but CS will teach you a new way of thinking about the world.  Professor Cannon covers the basics of both hardware (the physical structure of the computer) and programming, so by the time you're done with the course you will probably know which topic you like better.  Lectures supplemented the readings and helped clarify which aspects of the materials were the most important.  One of Professor Cannon's strengths was making complicated concepts understandable.  He is willing to go over the same idea more than once, even at the expense of glossing over a few simpler programming concepts that I would have liked the lectures and assignments to cover a bit more thoroughly.  The final was DEFINITELY harder than the midterm, although neither was excessively difficult.

It's a good idea for people without a very strong programming/hardware background to take W1004--you learn quite a bit about both and are a much more fluid programmer by the time you reach the more advanced courses.  Professor Cannon was very good at introducing us to the academic organizations and resources the CS department offers.

The fact that there are many TAs means that you should be able to come to a good TA's office hours (in my experience, decent to good TAing was the rule rather than the exception).  Professor Cannon is also accessible and reasonably flexible.","THIS COURSE IS NOT A JOKE!!!  For me, the workload was 5-18 hours a week.

I thought he was joking. HE WAS NOT. This is a great class and he's pretty good at explaining concepts (if you pay attention), and he's understanding about extensions and going over certain topics more in-depth if the class needs it. But the weekly assignments were pretty difficult and/or very time-consuming. You MUST start each assignment at least 4-5 days before the due date, because you will run into problems with your programs and you need time to meet with the TA's. I found that many students taking the class had prior programming experience and they found it easier (and messed up the curve). But for the rest of us it was a grueling learning experience. I'm glad to have taken it but you need to invest time, no joke.","Weekly assignments, alternating between theory and programming. One midterm and one final.

With a couple of masters degrees and a phd, you know he's incredibly smart, but he also keeps the class moving well with his wit. Class attendance is typically helpful, but you can get by for most topics by simply doing the assigned reading. If you do attend class, supplementation with assigned reading is still ideal. The texts for the class are pricey so get them from a friend or rent them if possible.

I would recommend going to office hours - the TAs are generally pretty helpful, and it's useful to get feedback on your code before you submit it.

The programming assignments were a lot of fun, once you get into them. The book assignments (the theoretical ones) can be a pain, but they're necessary to grasp the material fully.

It's not necessarily the easiest class that you'll take at Columbia (unless you're already a programmer and therefore shouldn't be taking this class anyway).

I believe he's been teaching this class for several years, every semester and so the class is well-planned and thought out.

I would recommend going to all the lectures, you'll really learn a lot and also you probably won't have to spend much time reading Big Java for the assignments if you attend class. Plus Cannon always goes on random CS-related tangents every once in a while and these are generally fun and informative.

As for the class, it's got two components; theory (Intro to CS) and programming (Intro to Java). Theory and programming homeworks alternate from week to week. Theory homeworks are not too bad, they can be done just from reading the relevant chapters in the book. Programming ones can be challenging and take varying amounts of time (depending on who you are) but you will certainly learn how to program at the end of it.

Midterm and final aren't all that bad if you've been keeping up with the lectures and the homeworks. They're a bit on the memorization side of things - especially the final which asked some pretty obscure questions which is why it's good to attend lecture because he often mentions random things that I noticed ended up on the test.

I should mention that although this is intro CS, it's a pretty high level intro so don't take the class for the granted - you'll have to put in some work to get an A.

Also there are lots of office hours and for the most part the TAs are great so I would highly recommend popping in if you have question regarding your assignment; even if you code works, you might wanna just make sure with the TAs that your design, etc. is okay.","See above.","7","Intro to Computer Science- Programming in Java","COMS W1004"

Since it is an INTRO course to computer science and java, he does a really great job at explaining concepts, etc. and will happily answer any question.  You will learn so much more from being in class than by reading the textbook.

That being said, read the textbook and make notes!  The midterm and final both include a vocabulary section - where you have to write a definition for the given words (note, Cannon gave us a list of 100 possible terms for the final and tested us on 10).

The midterm is really easy if you're prepared.  Do the work, meet with TA's, etc. etc. etc.

The programming assignments will take a lot of time, so definitely do NOT start the night before they are due.

Let me say again - Cannon is a phenomenal teacher.  He is an amazing lecturer and makes class fun.  He always has a good story, funny / snide remark, or riddle / brainteaser to share.

That being said, it was probably my favorite class thus far. Cannon is just a wonderful man who makes the lectures interesting, fun, and clear. He is incredibly welcoming ad supportive, so absolutely take advantage of his office hours. Talk to him about any concerns that you have - whether it's a specific coding problem or worries about the class in general - and he will help you. 

If you're not a computer science person, there is a lower level class that provides a lot of the background for this class, which I didn't know about, and could have done much better had I taken it. This is not an easy class, but it's very fulfilling. It's something I never could have seen myself doing, but I would absolutely recommend taking it. ","It's pretty tough.

There was a lot of learning on ones own simply because there was so much material, but there were resources there for use that could make ones life a whole lot easier, such as TAs.  This is where I have to disagree with the previous reviewer.  Madhavan was a standout TA.  He stayed after his office hours by as much as three hours one time because people needed help.  When he was in the TA room attending office hours for his own CompSci classes, he would help 1004 kids who needed help.  No matter how many people came he would individually go through his students code to find problems big and small.  He also didnt treat students who didnt know things like idiots which is more than can be said for some others of the TAs.  I would know, I went to pretty much every TAs office hours.  Madhavan was not an easy grader, but thats because he knows his stuff and demands a high standard; if you dont want to be held to a high standard, dont go to Columbia.

"70","3807","Sun, 29 Jan 2012 20:06:45 GMT","27008","515","I actually took this class last year, spring semester but haven't got a chance to review it yet. Let me just say that there aren't many classes I'd actually feel obligated to review, but this is definitely one of them.

This is so far the best class I've taken at Columbia. This class gives you a great overview of Computer Science, and an unmatched introduction to programming. Somehow Cannon manages to fit in a ton of material while still giving a good sense of each topic. The only exception to this would be the section of the class on computer networks, which I honestly feel could have been narrowed down to just the information about internet protocols. 

Learning object-oriented programming has a learning curve, but once you've got it, you're just coasting from then on. That's not to say projects don't take a while -- you'll spend hours trying to find bugs in your program. But in general, I think there's only a few concepts in this class that are difficult to learn, the main one being OOP. Nonetheless, Cannon and the TAs make themselves pretty available to you, and the assignments are not unreasonable. That being said, pay attention to what Cannon says: if he wants you to understand a concept by a certain homework (e.g. what objects are) you should do it, and you'll be fine.

I think the main idea I want to convey with this review is that the work you do, while heavy, is very meaningful, and you'll learn a lot about algorithmic problem solving and programming in Java.","As mentioned, pretty heavy, but the work you're given is very meaningful, and you'll have a far elevated understanding of programming and CS by the end of the course. Tests have tricks here and there, but if you understand the concepts they're pretty easy.

"71","3807","Thu, 12 Apr 2012 04:15:52 GMT","27128","515","Well, he already has his silver nugget, but let it be said: Cannon deserves it. His lectures are fun to go to, and he tries really hard. I usually feel bad when people don't laugh at his dumb jokes so I laugh pretty hard to give him some credit. I usually enjoyed going to lecture. I never brought my computer, though, because all his example code is posted on courseworks anyway. You can do your note-taking just as well in a traditional notebook, and if you know that you are easily distracted, I'd recommend not bringing a computer. The two lectures that I did bring one I may as well not even have showed up because I have no idea what happened.

The course itself is hard, for sure. This class is an introduction CS and programming class, so if you never took AP Computer Science in high school, you're going into a topic that you've literally never seen before, unlike most of your other classes. It's pretty satisfying, though, when a few weeks in you're already writing simple programs that can do tasks that you couldn't do a few weeks before.

The programming assignments are tough, especially compared to the homework which literally take maybe 1-2 hours tops. Programming takes probably 10ish hours. The singular most important advice is go to the TA office hours. There are like 8 TAs for the class. Obviously the TA hours the day before your assignment is due are going to be packed, so try to go earlier if you can. The ones in the middle of the week are literally empty so you could have one-on-one time to do your work with a TA sitting right there who sole purpose is to answer any questions you have and help with your programming.

Cannon also sets up an account for the class on this website, Piazza.com, that is basically a messaging board where people can ask questions and the TAs, other students and Cannon (occasionally) can answer questions. This is a really good resource because your question has almost always been asked by someone else, and you can ask questions anonymously.","1 programming assignment every other week (10 hours give or take 2 or 3), 1 homework every other week (1-3 hours), 1 midterm, 1 final. Midterm is multiple choice, definitions, a section of code to debug, and an algorithm with questions about it.

However, going to a TA other than the one who is going to grade your problem set is usually a waste of time because the open-ended short answer problems are subjectively and sometimes harshly graded. For programming assignments, all the TAs are amazing and Cannon gives good advice during class.

"74","3807","Thu, 26 Dec 2013 02:09:34 GMT","28972","515","Adam Cannon is a pretty solid teacher. He knows his stuff, and is very organized when teaching. With this in mind, Intro to Java is probably one of the most challenging and time-consuming classes offered at Columbia. Unless you have to take this class for your major, be sure you REALLY want to take this class. There are much easier ways to learn coding and Java. When Cannon tells you at the beginning that this class will take at least 10 hours of work per week, he is telling the truth. Many times, the work requires a lot more than 10 hours/week. 

There is a lot of information that Cannon tries to teach in this course. You will learn both theory and programming in this class. Because of the amount of info he tries to teach, Cannon skips over a lot of basic stuff that he expects you to learn on your own. I had no experience in programming coming in so I wish he would not have skipped over stuff. For this reason, I would only recommend this class to someone who has some experience or background in coding. Talking to many who were in the same boat as me, we had to play catch-up throughout the semester. This class is already considered difficult to those with coding backgrounds, so it makes life even more miserable when you have to put even more work into an already difficult class.

The TAs for the class are usually pretty helpful. I would recommend getting help from the TA that grades your assignments since some of the grading, especially the written assignments, can be very subjective. I also went to Cannon's office hours. He does not come off as the nicest or most personable person ever, but he does try to help you out. He definitely does not try or care to get to know students (at least in this class). I will give him props for his cheesy jokes that lighten up the class.

In the end, you really have to decide if you are willing to do the work for the class. If you just want to take this class because you think coding will be ""fun"" to learn, do not take the class. Learn coding on your own at a pace where it can be fun, exciting, and addictive. Besides those who are majoring in CS, only those who are serious about learning Java and the theory of programming in a rigorous and often cutthroat setting should take this class.","The HW alternates between a programming assignment and written assignment. 1 midterm and 1 final. At least 10 hours/week is needed to do well in the class. Make sure you read the textbooks since he glosses over some stuff in class.

As I look back on this semester, I have come to the conclusion that yes, it is possible to take this course without prior knowledge of programming. However, it will require a lot of work on your part. If you're up for a challenge, this is the course for you.

In terms of personality, Cannon is quite friendly and cracks pretty good jokes in lecture. In his office hours, I found Cannon to be quite helpful and not at all sarcastic, in contrast to what other reviewers have said (but that might be because I came on a day in which very few students were asking him for help). 

Cannon is a decent lecturer, although he goes through concepts and examples very quickly. If you don't ask questions or follow up his lectures with your reading, you will get left behind. Be sure that you keep up at all times! (also, the textbooks for this class are quite helpful).

For problem sets and programming projects, do not procrastinate! They take much more time than you think they do (he's not kidding when he says that the class will require at least nine hours of work per week). If you get stuck, go to office hours, ask a CS friend, or use Piazza (the online messaging board) to get your questions answered. 

Overall, I'm glad that I took this course. It was challenging and I might not get the grade I want, but I'm glad that I learned something new.

"78","4079","Wed, 08 Jan 2014 23:44:52 GMT","29091","1342","First off I enjoyed the course and think Prof. Stein is an excellent teacher. His lectures do a good job of explaining some very dense material and he also is engaging and manages to keep a relatively light tone despite the large class size. He seems well prepared and obviously is a master of the material. Sometimes when you take a course where the teacher is also the textbook author you might as well just stay home and read the book; however with this class Prof. Stein manages to add a lot of value despite covering mostly similar material to the book. The book itself is pretty good too although occasionally too terse.

The material itself is critical to any advanced CS study - either research or advanced development - and so I would recommend it to anyone looking at or already in grad school or who wants to get a highly competitive job at a top company. That said, if all you want to do is get a decent entry level CS job this material is more challenging than what you need to know.

Speaking of challenging material the class is VERY hard. Primarily this is due to the HW. With one or two exceptions each of the seven problem sets is extremely long and difficult. And (as has been pointed out) cheating is rampant. If you want to get the mean or better without cheating be prepared to invest at least twenty hours on each HW.

I actually thought the midterm was great. Since the questions were brand new you couldn't cheat from the internet and so I felt the long hours I put into it were rewarded with a good score above the mean. This is in contrast to the HWs where no matter how hard I worked I generally got an average grade.

I also thought the questions on the final were fair although I was surprised at my grade (which wasn't bad but wasn't good either). C'est la vie, you can't win them all. Certainly the questions on both the midterm and final are easier than on the HWs.

Overall I loved the class although I think it would be even better if they reduced the amount of HW and used easier questions written from scratch each semester so people couldn't cheat from the internet. I do understand this would be a lot of work for the staff. As it stands right now hard work on the problem sets will help you learn the material very well, but can be frustrating due to sheer volume and the fact many people cheat/collaborate.

Curve seemed fair to me but I haven't discussed grades with anyone else in the class. Overall TAs seemed pretty good. Some logistical hiccups (not nearly enough seats in lecture hall, HWs returned via huge pile/mad rush method) but generally grading was quick. Feedback on Piazza questions a bit skimpy but not bad.

TL;DR - really enjoyed the class overall, particularly the rigorous material and good lectures. Prof is high quality. Have mixed feelings regarding the huge HWs. Textbook is relatively good.","Extremely high primarily due to HW. 7 HW problem sets (30% total), one of these is half size but the others are all pretty brutal.

The homeworks were excellent. They were long and arduous, but you had sufficient time (two weeks) and plenty of office hours. I really learned a lot through the homeworks, and they prepared me really well for the midterm/final.

It's a huge class, so be prepared for other people to cheat, make noise, grumble, etc. Ignore it, and take the class anyways, because it's worth it.

While the huge size of the class was definitely not optimal, Stein has mastered the art of teaching a large class.  The class definitely covers a lot of dense material, but the instructor did a great job picking out the important ideas without getting bogged down and trying to cover every last line of the textbook.  He's without question one of the best lecturers I've had at this school.  I know that often taking a class from the author of the textbook can mean that lecture notes seem like copies of the textbook, but that is not the case in this class.  I found his presentation a bit friendlier and more streamlines than the book, and he was also quite funny and brought great energy to the class.  The book could be terse, but it was definitely helpful to refer to after lectures for more details.

As people have mentioned previously, the workload is intense.  Each of the seven homework assignments are incredibly long.  I don't think I've ever spent so much time on homework assignments for a class.  I learned a ton from completing them, but they definitely could've been a bit shorter without compromising much value.  With that in mind, this is definitely not a class to undertake lightly.

The exams were much more straightforward than the assignments, and if you put a lot of effort into the assignments, it would be reflected on the exams.  It was very frustrating that so many people cheated on homework assignments for perfect scores.  I don't really have a good answer to this, as I too was very frustrated by it.  Seeing as this happened, giving a take home midterm might not have been the best idea.  The grading seemed fair to generous, especially for undergrads who were curved separately.

"81","4079","Fri, 23 May 2014 15:20:23 GMT","29559","12932","Xi is a pretty decent teacher. Going into this class, there were no previous CULPA reviews on him and the only thing I heard about him was that he was ""not bad"". I would say Xi's a bit better than ""not bad"".

Typically, classes like Algorithms go really fast, leaving most students lost and confused. Xi is good in this sense because he teaches at a slower pace so it's easier to understand the long proofs and sometimes dense material. The drawback of his speed is that we didn't finish the syllabus. We missed 2 classes because of snow days and another 3 classes because Xi was overly ambitious to cover so much material at his teaching pace. He also posts excellent slides online so you don't have to worry if you missed something in class.

The class itself is pretty hard. The book CLRS, while excellent, is quite dense and detailed. Homework was almost completely assigned from the exercises in the book, which are nearly impossible the solve. The HW averages were pretty high (around 55/60). This is because solutions to problems from CLRS are available online if you search carefully enough. I highly recommend you don't do this since you will get screwed come exam time. Xi is super helpful in Office Hours and you should go to him if you get stuck on HW (because you will, trust me). He will walk you through any problem and give you an outline of the solution. Sometimes, the problems are so hard, that Xi himself can't solve them on the spot (not knocking on Xi; he's really smart. I'm just saying the problems are that difficult). 

The midterm was much easier than the problem sets, but still far from easy. One question on perfect hashing which worth 20 points could be solved only if you remembered a proof from his lecture slides. Most people didn't get it, so remember to read his slides thoroughly. Grading was fair, maybe a bit strict.

Final was similar to the midterm in difficulty and was a bit longer, but you had 3 hours which was plenty of time. I thought the final was easier, but I ended up getting a lower score on it than the midterm, so I don't know what to make of it.

The class had roughly 8 undergrads out of a 100 students, so be prepared to be lonely. There are PhD students in this class, so don't expect to ace it, though getting an A shouldn't be a problem if you put the effort into this class. I'm not sure if he curves undergrads separately.

Overall, it's a good class. You will learn a lot and become much better at constructing solid proofs and thinking algorithmically. I think Xi is just as good as Stein, so feel free to take this class with him.","7 Homeworks (40%) : incredibly hard, take 20+ hrs each

In general, my take on this semester is the same as my review of CS Theory with Yannakakis, though this time the lecture hall wasn't so sleep-inducing. Yannakakis is not exactly an exciting lecturer, but charisma aside, he does everything he should: he chooses a good textbook, assigns homework that reinforces and expands a bit on the material, has a TA who grades fairly, provides good lecture notes online, and so on and so forth. My only real complaint is that the class overlapped a lot for the first month with CS Theory, but given how many people were confused by really basic issues about Turing Machines, I guess that wasn't Yannakakis' fault.

I'd definitely take a third class with him if the opportunity presented itself.","Homework every other week (not terribly difficult), no midterm, a take-home final.","7","Introduction to Computational Complexity","COMS W4236"

This was my second class with him, the first being CS Theory in the fall, and with that said, I am confident that he is a good choice for any class he is teaching.  I will definitely take another class with him if the opportunity comes up.

While he might not be a dazzling speaker, he is always well-prepared with very structured lecture plans and does a great job presenting the material.  The material is very well-motivated and he involves the class in his lectures by frequently asking questions.  He is able to thoroughly answer any question that comes up from the class.  There are few to no errors in the lectures, and detailed lecture notes are posted on Courseworks.  The textbook is the bible for the subject and it is well-written, but he doesnt strictly follow it, so its really not necessary for the course.  

The homework assignments were also very well-written and unambiguous, and ultimately at the heart of the course.  I definitely learned a lot from working through them.  While this class is the natural follow-up to CS theory, one difference is that there are fewer formulaic problems that simply require following an algorithm.  Usually a bit of thought is required for most of the homework problems, but theyre manageable as long as you dont leave them until the last minute.  Hints are generously provided for more difficult problems.  

I agree with the previous review that the Turing Machine topic at the beginning of the course couldve been shorted.  Much of that material was familiar for CS Theory, and it was without doubt the least interesting part of this course.

His homeworks and exams are reasonably challenging but also completely fair -- don't worry if you get a 60% on an exam because it will come out in the curve.

Furthermore, he always knows what he's talking about (more than some professors) as a result of an expansive knowledge of all aspects of databases thus far.  Now that I have gotten to know him better, it seems this stems from a more passionate interest in the subject than I've seen with others in their respective fields and it leads to a genuine desire to help students really master the material.

I would definitely recommend taking the 6111 course if 4111 was at all interesting.","Reasonable workload, but group projects are easily do-

"88","4956","Wed, 04 Jun 2014 05:06:27 GMT","29612","375","This is an acceptable course, but I have mixed feelings about it. Let's establish some baseline. Dr. Gravano is undoubtedly a capable lecturer, able to explain concepts lucidly. He occasionally told jokes that made the classroom laugh (sometimes). I'm pretty certain he genuinely cares for his students. You will almost certainly learn a lot of new and useful stuff while taking this course. Overall, the course was planned and executed well.

If you are on the NLP or ML track  or you have a strong interest in search engines or big data, you should certainly take this course. This course definitely falls squarely in that domain (I mean hey, the free textbook was on the NLP part of Stanford's website...). I suspect the facts you will learn will be very relevant to you. However, if you are on the software track taking this course just because it has good reviews and fulfills a requirement, I'd suggest giving other courses stronger consideration. I don't exactly regret taking this class, but I think I could have chosen better.

Dr. Gravano curves the median to a B+ or A-. You may be thinking Sure, I'll just score above average! but in a 90 something class full of smart people and easy assignments and tests, this is tricky to do  and there is a good component of luck involved.

The two tests which comprise 50% of your grade are themselves comprised of about 40% (each) true false questions. That's 20% of your grade roughly!  I felt that some of them were vaguely worded and it's pretty hit or miss if you remember the specific fact the question tests you on.

You'll either need a very good memory or be very planned and careful how you review the lectures, because you really could get tested on any bullet point in them. It's fair and doable, but that's not my style. I'd rather be tested on my ability to apply what I learned to solve problems than my ability to simply remember details about stuff I could recall by referring to the textbook or my notes (neither of which are allowed on the exams).  Oh, and the readings are often straight torture. Thankfully, I don't ever remember seeing a question that was in the reading but not the lecture. Much of the writing was by authors showing off their ability to encrypt simple concepts into Latex strings. Dr. Gravano's lectures blew the textbook out of the water.

The rest of the tests involve manually carrying out an algorithm he discussed in the lecture. The tests are easy, but I'm really not a fan of easy tests because mistakes will cost you a lot more. But that's obviously my opinion... you might think otherwise. 

The HWs (java or python) certainly aren't trivial, but they aren't complicated either. The class generally averaged 9/10 on them with a very small standard deviation. I think I learned more about Python than I did about search algorithms or the subject matter of the class while doing the assignments. The first and last project implemented an algorithm that is probably only a step or two above the complexity of what you would encounter in an undergraduate data structures class at a reasonably competitive school. The second project mostly involved string formatting and learning how to use the API to google's open knowledge database. Personally, I found it pretty tedious. 

This is not to say the assignments can be finished in two days. The API in the second project took forever to figure out, but I'd really rather invest my energy somewhere other than learning an API I won't use again in the foreseeable future. 

In the grand scheme of things, this is not a bad class. Good for some people, less so for others. As you can tell by the other positive reviews, some folks do enjoy it. I see where they are coming from. Some of the things I don't like about the class are a matter of personal taste. I hazard to say you will likely get your tuition's worth on this class. If you are NLP or ML I think you almost certainly will. I'm just saying this class isn't for everyone.","The workload is medium-light.

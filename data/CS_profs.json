Prof Allen does not really curve, and if he did it didn't affect my grade much. He did drop the lowest HW, which was predictable as he repeatedly mentioned that you could afford to mess up one HW. Allen has little patience for BS, so don't ask him stupid questions, don't stand in front of the room, even to grab a handout, when he's lecturing, and don't tell him he isn't teaching the material we need to do the HW -- he practically tore one student apart when he was asked for techniques used for hasing. The student felt we weren't given enough options to meet his desired # of collisions, and Prof. Allen practically walked him through all the examples in the book. Come to find an email in all our mailboxes later that his required max number of collisions was off by a factor of 3. Oops. Basically, if you start early on the assignments, this class will be very rewarding and will help you progress greatly as a coder. Allen makes learning the material incredibly easy, as his lectures are so easy to listen to.

He may not take any bullshit, but he hands it out in huge buckets by making his students write Swing interfaces for every assignment.  So when do you write the actual *data structures and algorithms*?  You don't -- you copy the textbook's code, then stay up 'till 5am writing 5000 lines of JFrames and JOptionPanes.\n\nI've tutored literally dozens of Allen's 3137 students, and the only thing they seem to have learned from him was bad coding style.  It's not all his fault -- if the CS dep't is going to use Java, then 1007 has to teach the basics of OOP.  Yet almost no students come into 3137 understanding the basic concepts of abstraction, and Allen goes out of his way to make the situation worse.\n\nFor example, here's one absolute law: Keep the data structures and the GUI in different classes!  If Allen were really a no-BS kinda guy, he'd give zero credit for anyone who put Swing code in their Stack, BST, etc. classes.  As it is, his 3137 is a lesson in producing awful hacks.  Laying your code out in a clean, maintainable way is a THOUSAND TIMES more important than blindly adding Swing objects to an ADT class until something appears on the screen.  But Allen requires none of the former and oodles of the latter.\n\nThis the kind of class that makes people hate CS.  Compare it to a really successful and challenging course, like MIT's 6.001 or even Gross's Discrete Math here, and you see how we're shortchanging our students and turning potentially talented programmers away from CS for life.

The class has some rather cool aspects about it, including the use of a robot simulator.  You actually apply concepts from linear algebra to something.

Also, get comfortable when he starts to walk through an example, because he'll take you through the WHOLE thing, even if the process is the same in the first 10% of the example as it is in the last 90%.\nIf you take this class, be prepared to work.

      "review_text": "I took Data Structures & Algorithms during the Fall 2009 semester, which was taught by Peter Allen.\r\n\r\nThe Course:\r\n   On the whole, I think Data Structures & Algorithms is a great course that gives CS students a solid grounding in how to think about solving computational problems in ways that are efficient with respect to time complexity and memory usage.  While I learned a lot from this class, I think it would have been possible to make it slightly more advanced than it was.  There was a fair amount of overlap with the data structures component of COMS 1007 and, in my opinion, not enough time was spent on learning more complicated algorithms and data structures.  Nevertheless, at this point, I feel that I have a solid understanding of all basic and intermediate DSA, which is of course extremely critical to success in CS.  My only other complaints about this class are that the homework assignments were a bit too easy (or at least were graded as such) and that the programming assignments all required GUIs, which ended up requiring more time and effort to implement than the algorithms themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Professor:\r\n   Professor Allen is an excellent lecturer who does a great job of making sure that the concepts that he's presenting are clear and that the students have thorough exposure to how a particular algorithm works.  I read an earlier review that said that Professor Allen can be an asshole who berates students for asking questions/giving answers.  While I must say that there were a couple exchanges that Professor Allen handled in a bit of a confrontational way, I think this was unintentional, and I think he really does care about his students and their success.  He is also a very funny guy, so I think sometimes his humor is such that his jokes could be construed as reproaches.  He is very helpful both in office hours and over email.  Additionally, his handouts are so fantastic that I anticipate using them as reference materials for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe TAs:\r\n   While generally I don't think a TA's contribution to a class merits review (positive or negative), I believe that Dan Federman warrants an exception (positive).  First of all, as a recitation instructor, Dan was very good at both reviewing things that Professor Allen had gone over during lecture as well as delving deeper into certain topics that were either not discussed at all in lecture or were merely glossed over.  In addition, I found Dan's recitations to be extremely helpful when it came to clarifying the details of our various assignments.  DSA required every assignment to be implemented with a GUI, which could have proven to be exceedingly burdensome were it not for Dan's ability to explain the finer points of Java AWT/Swing.  Dan's recitations were effective not only as a consequence of his intelligence and knowledge of the subject, but also because of his ability to present material in a very dynamic and engaging way.  Secondly, from an administrative standpoint, Dan was incredibly responsive when it came to fielding questions about the logistics or the substance of the course.  Finally, Dan made a point of putting the class into a \"real-world\" context by discussing the kinds of applications the various data structures might have or by going over what sorts of DSA-related questions might come up in interviews.  This information is invaluable and was extremely helpful.  I am taking CS classes at Columbia as a postbac, and so I have had plenty of experiences with TAs as points of comparison.  Having said that, I can honestly say that Dan is as effective a TA as any I have had in my academic career.",

Most of the codes are provided by the textbook, so you don't really have to memorize how to write them, but you do need to know how they work. Most of the questions on the test and the hw require you to apply an algorithm to a set of data and show their results. The materials covered are not too difficult, and as long as you can think abstractly and understand what you are trying to do, you'll be fine.\r\n\r\nProfessor Allen is an excellent lecturer who presents the materials very clearly. He uses powerpoints for the lectures and every time we get to some code, he would stops and demonstrate how it worked on the blackboard. His lectures notes which he posts online are concise and super helpful. The lecture notes extract the things you need to know from the textbook without going into excessive details and get boring, as the textbook tends to do. In fact, I almost never had to use the book other than to do the assignment from the back of each chapter. You can get by on his notes alone without going to class or read the book, but I highly recommend you to attend the lectures when possible because he actually explains everything in details.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments were not difficult. There's usually a couple of questions from the back of the chapters and 1 or 2 programming questions that'll take you about 3 to 6 hours if you know what you are doing and maybe 10 hours if you are really lost or have little experience in programming.

Allen is a lenient grader for the projects, but not for the midterms. This is definitely an \"application\" class, not really a \"theory\" class. Take it if programming a Roomba sounds like something you would like to do; for all its flaws I enjoyed it well enough.",

BUT WITH THAT SAID...\r\n\r\nI strongly disliked this course with Allen for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1) A good chunk of the homework was focused on Java GUI's as opposed to actual data structures. There was minimal to no assistance in constructing these GUI's, which meant you had to spend large chunks of time scanning tedious API documentation to try to figure out how to do things, instead of spending time actually learning and implementing the data structures. Also, I found this frustrating because Java GUI's are increasingly becoming an antiquated form of user interface in industry, which spending the time to teach them to myself seem irrelevant. In my opinion, it would make a lot more sense to include extensive implementation of Java GUI's in W1007.\r\n\r\n2) Professor Allen is actually condescending to students. There were numerous Piazza posts where students would ask questions that were fairly reasonable and his responses would be incredibly and unnecessarily snarky (i.e. Student: \"Can we assume ___ about problem X?\" Professor: \"Can we assume gravity exists?\"). In class, this attitude discouraged students from answering/asking questions.\r\n\r\nSomething I love/hated about the class was that his lectures were literally him reading through his class notes, which were posted on the course website. This meant that going to class always felt like a waste of time (you could literally not go and just read the slides and be fine), which was simultaneously awesome and terrible.\r\n\r\nOverall, I do feel like my knowledge of data structures has improved since the beginning of the course (specifically with Trees and Graphs), but if I could do it again, I would definitely take this course with someone else.",

Like in some other comp sci courses (ahem, OS), you get the feeling that the professor and TAs started out with very ambitious assignments that they were going to prepare students for -- until they forgot to do the preparation part. But even that may be being overly generous, because the net result is inexcusable: students have no clue how to approach the programming, and TA office hours (again, so much like OS and other high-level CS classes) turn into unofficial cheating sessions where beleagured TAs have no choice but to disseminate crucial information (that the rest of the class doesn't get).

It is a field that is completely ignored in ALL other classes, and it is quite important. Unlike most courses in the department  it actually practical and applicable to anything you'll ever program. I do agree with all previous (bad) reviews. However, the problem with the allegedly harsh grading of the homework is that most of the grade is not based on functionality. Your program may follow all specs, but still get a C. It is the USER INTERFACE that gets you most of the credit. And you can only start thinking of user interface AFTER you completed all specs, which is usually around 5am the night before it is due. And that is truely a big problem with this class. But as you know from the previous reviews, you get some penalty-free late days to use on any combination of the first 3 (!!!)assignments. Another major problem is that there is a lot of reading, and it is all asked about in the midterm and final. As a rule of thumb, if there is a formula of some sort in any of the papers, it will appear eventually on a test. You will probably have to state it and explain it. Nothing too fancy, but you do need to memorize a bunch of them like it's a high-school history test. Not the end of the world, though. \nIt is true, this class feels more like a Humanities class that a regular CS class. You have to read a lot papers, and there are never problem sets (only programming projects with minor explanations of \"why did you choose the interface that you did\"). It is, though, not the hardest class you have taken or will take in the department, and it opens a window to a very neglected (and again, practical) area of compters. Lets face it, in the real world, your boss/client is much more likely  to care about the interface of your program. And like in this class, they are going to take the functionality as a given.",

As a rule of thumb, after reading every chapter ask yourself 5 feasible questions he can ask. It's pretty obvious. There is no way around reading all research papers, and don't fool yourself you will have enough time to read even a quarter of them during finals.  However, like in every class like this, nobody has time to do all the reading and there's a curve. The midterm and final consist only of essay questions. The trick is that if you understand the general theory (mostly from the book) and use \"the UID language,\" you can totally b/s and get some partial credit on occasion. Finer travels a lot, so there are many occasions that there is a gust lecture, some of them really cool."

It was mainly because the assignments were time-consuming and they demanded dedication, and also the ability of Prof Kender to succintly pointed out all crucial aspects of Java and OOD.\r\n\r\nProf Kender is very good-natured. He looks tired sometimes but he is full of energy when it comes to lecture time. He is very approachable, and he answers all questions you have in mind. He is very funny in his own way. And above all those, he is a very, very fair grader. (And of course TAs in this course are just like that.)\r\n\r\nThose who wants to master in programming will not regret taking this class. You will learn much more than the Java itself; you will encounter a lot of situations where you have to decide in terms of design and strategy.

Lectures were very well-structured and easy to follow without being simplistic, and although the material was occasionally a bit dry (idiom memorization is not exactly thrilling), Kender's understated and offbeat sense of humor kept things interesting. He puts the material into perspective--the class is taught only in Java, but he explained the language's current (and rapidly shrinking) place in the field and how it differed from other languages (often in the form of deadpan disparagements). While he spent a good portion of the first few weeks of class waiting for students to answer questions, eventually the class began to respond and lectures became more smooth and interactive. Despite a scant four-month programming background, I felt comfortable with the material largely due to the clarity and thoroughness of the lectures.\r\n\r\nWhile the first assignment was difficult, Kender polled the class on our experience and modified the next assignment based on the responses (similar polls happened after all assignments and the midterm), which I really appreciated. He took pains to keep the class fair despite challenging material.",

But since he is too intimidating for any students to just walk up to him and hug, he penalizes us by giving us incredibly challenging (but fun) assignments.\r\n\r\nHis lectures, most of the time, grabs your attention and doesn't let go. The only boring parts would be the ones where he tells us about the necessary evils of memorizing idioms. Even those, however, coupled with Prof. Kender's otherwordly sense of humor and enthusiasm, are possible to get through completely awake and conscious.\r\n\r\nThe assignments are quite difficult, yes, and many people dropped the course halfway through because of a certain assignment. (It personally took two all-nighters in Butler.) But if you enjoy computer science at all, the challenges he throws at you and the sense of accomplishment that you get when you finish will be enough to keep you going throughout the entire semester.\r\n\r\nFYI, don't worry about the numerical grade that you get. Prof. Kender grades hard on all assignments and tests, and the numerical grades may seem low.

He is not only an amazing professor, but an amazing person and makes you feel he cares, even if you've never spoken directly with him.

In class, this leads to him calling on several people before he hears exactly what he wants to hear. He often gets exasperated at people not saying the right answer immediately. What's important to note is that often the right answer has been said, but he just didn't notice because he was too fixated on having it said exactly how he thinks it should be.\r\n\r\nThat's how it was on the exams as well. Clearly, he thought of the answers before he thought of the questions, and didn't spend much time thinking about how to phrase the questions. They were completely incomprehensible. On the midterm, he even gave us all an extra 8 points because he admitted that one question was so terribly convoluted. On the final, the chalk boards were covered by the end of the exam because of how many changes he made to the directions. I must have lost 20 minutes going back and redoing stuff because he was redefining the questions as we were taking the exam!\r\n\r\nThe work load is enormous in this class. Again, the questions were often ambiguous. If you badgered him on the discussion board, he'd sometimes clarify things. He also didn't check the API before assigning some of the graphics stuff. I must have spent 20+ hours combined trying to work around bugs in the API to try to make my designs the way he wanted them. I even sat down with him once in office hours to read through some unofficial API source code, given that his response to one of these bugs was, \"Hmmm...that's unexpected...\"\r\n\r\nOverall, this class was the most frustrating experience of my semester. If I didn't have to take it, I wouldn't have. I don't feel like I learned that much (except for some interesting stuff in chapter 7 about generics). I feel like if Kender had been focused, it might have been a semi-enjoyable experience. He was too much in his own head and didn't interact well with students, though.",

For each assignment, we were given at least two weeks if not more. Kender, though as inscrutable as Dumbledore in his answers, will point you in the general right direction through discussion boards, and office hours with the TAs and Kender himself will help you if you're ever feeling totally lost--but to take advantage of this, you MUST start the assignment earlier than the weekend before they're due. They can take up to a whole weekend to do but often much less. They are difficult, but they can be fun and you'll learn something from each one.\r\n\r\nSecond, as for the phrasing of questions, he just likes for you to state the reason behind the answer rather than rote memorization. To reiterate what previous reviews have said, he seems grumpy but he's really a sweet, witty, silver nugget-worthy guy.\r\n\r\nHe's like an m&m with a hard crunchy outer coating but is really just a sweet, melty, softy on the inside. If you really took his exasperation to heart, then do yourself a favor and get over yourself. He's not a kindergarten teacher who will hug you and listen to your feelings but he will go well out of his way to help you as much as he can without straight up giving you the answer. He wants you to oh my god forbid learn something instead of cruising out with a B+.\r\n \r\nThe grading was very reasonable(not EASY, reasonable), he explained how and why the grades were the way they were, acknowledged when things were unfair, took our feedback into account very well, and if you had a problem with this good luck at Columbia because the fact he even TOOK feedback was like, shocking, at this school.

If 1004 and the old OOP course had a baby, this monstrosity of a course would be the result. The course had no target audience. It was excessively basic for some, and impossibly difficult for others. In fact, this was evident from our midterm scores - the curve had two peaks!\r\n\r\nThat said, this was an exceptionally well taught course thanks to Professor Kender. This man can teach. Kender is truly silver (possible gold) nugget worthy. While the content of the course was not the best, (not Kender's fault - he has to comply with the CS department) Kender did an amazing job at teaching it. His lectures were a joy to attend. He is organized and methodical and teaches in the order of the chapters in the book. He has a great sense of humor and tells at least one awesome joke per class. He also gave us lots of cool extra information because this is \"an honors class\". Also, he has this strange, but fun obsession with the Principle of Least Surprise (PoLS).\r\n\r\nDon't let Kender's imposing figure scare you. He is a very approachable and reasonable professor who will take the time to help you out. If you're too intimidated to ask him a question in person, there's always the online solution. This course used Piazza which was great since it allowed us to ask questions anonymously and clarify doubts in the assignments. Kender is on Piazza almost 24x7 on the weekends before assignments are due.\r\n\r\nAssignments were of variable difficulty and length. Many of them were poorly worded causing some confusion. Some were very interesting like making a GUI game to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock with an AI engine. The assignments were usually graded within a week or two. The TAs were for the most part good. One TA (name not disclosed) was very stingy with grades and always screwed the assignments he graded. This unfair grading affected some very unlucky students.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final were long but manageable. Note down everything he says in class. His tests mainly consist of questions from topics discussed in class, especially violations of PoLS. Grading was extremely fair - not easy, not hard. He takes a long time to get exams back because he corrects all of them himself (and he unfortunately had an ill member in his family this semester). He gave us candy canes during the final because glucose apparently stimulates brain activity. Needless to say, that was the most entertaining exam ever.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you have a strong foundation in Java and design, skip this course. But try to take Kender whenever you can. He makes this course worth while with his godly teaching prowess and great sense of humor.",

The material was actually really interesting, and concretely brought together things I had learned in other CS classes.

Work not so hard and, well, you'll know the theory fairly well, but that's about it. This class requires a highly intimate knowledge of C--if you don't know it very well, then either skip the class or be prepared to read the K&R book thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe course covers the internals of the Linux kernel and we worked specifically with 2.6.11. Nieh covers mostly theory in class, and there is one text which goes over theory in more detail, and one which is a god-awful dry textbook (more like a manual, actually). The assigned readings aren't that long, and you will definitely need to do them--otherwise you will have no idea what the hell is going on. That being said, his lectures compliment the readings very nicely. Nieh was one of my better profs in terms of not \"teaching out of the book.\" However--Nieh is the person you go to if you don't understand theory. If you need help with the homework, skip him and go to the TAs directly (he has little involvement in the homeworks).\r\n\r\nFor each homework, you write a patch to the kernel that does something. After you submit, you have to meet with the TA for ~30 minutes to demo it, and they will also run their own test program on it. Be careful as they are NOT AT ALL forgiving if anything goes wrong--if you can't get it to work (even for a stupid error like you submitted the wrong file), you lose practically all points. Also, each HW has a written portion (~10 questions, usually 50% of the grade).\r\n\r\nHWs:\r\n1. Basic stuff, write a small shell, etc.\r\n2. syscall logger: not that hard, just an introduction to syscalls/the virtual machines you'll be using\r\n3. waitqueues/locking/threading stuff: you don't have to write that much code, just be careful what exactly you write.\r\n4. implemented a new scheduler type. most of the class just skipped this HW entirely, i recommend you give it a shot, but, don't bother if you can't get it.\r\n5. memory tracker: write a syscall that can track what chunks of memory you're using. requires you to go low-level with page tables, etc. tough but doable.\r\n6. process tree filesystem: make a filesystem that reflects the processes on a system. it's a lot easier than it sounds; he gives some examples of other pseudo filesystems in class.",

It was possible to skip one homework without a grade penalty. The first two assignments were not that difficult but 3-6 was very challenging.\r\n\r\nThe exams were in general pretty straight-forward if you had attended the lectures during the semester. The lectures however were rather slow and somewhat obstructed by irrelevant questions. The level of the lectures were much lower than what was required to finish the homeworks.\r\n\r\nThe best advice I can give for this class is to preferrably get familiar with C and Linux as much as possible before starting the class.

I have taken another OS course before this at another institution, and I have to say that a course like this should be mandatory for all CS students.\r\n\r\nJason is an excellent teacher, who is very approachable and answers any question with insight and dedication, so take this course with him if you have the chance.\r\n\r\nOnly criticism is that I think there should be a homework related to writing a driver/module instead of for instance changing the scheduler, as it is more relevant for most of the kernel work to be done by the majority of people. Also, the classes do seem a little slow at times, but I guess that's more of personal preference.",

You will get your hands dirty while building crucial features of Linux kernel on an Android device in \"C\" involving Synchronization, Scheduling, Paging, File Systems, etc(as per the projects in Fall 2012).\r\n\r\nYou will fine tune your \"C\" skills yourselves mainly in the area of optimizing the usage of the kernel resources in terms of memory. You keep an eye on what each function ends up returning to determine its success or failure - this comes with practice if you aren't in the habit!\r\n\r\nThe grading rubric is the most comprehensive one I have ever seen in my life. For each of the assignments/homework, the rubric would cover every nook and corner cases that a novice \"C\" programmer for Linux kernel would definitely ignore.\r\n\r\nWell, in the beginning you would find each of your submission being bitten by checkpatch, for not abiding by Linux kernel coding style. But, with time, your \"C\" coding style becomes smooth and elegant if you start respecting what that seemingly strict master(checkpatch) says, trust me!\r\n\r\nAh, userspace programs for each of the assignments! Well, I enjoyed much by dwelling in \"C\" while building the user space test programs for testing the Linux kernel features implemented in each of the assignments. You would be asked to demo each of the Linux kernel features you would implement in each homework and during the demo, well, how dedicated you were in testing your code gets rewarded when the standard test code(which they would have in their repositories) completes without any problem and you hear TA saying, \"That's cool!\".\r\n\r\nTAs were very helpful in answering the questions we had. Sometimes, we had to bug them and get the information what we want - but, they were all nice and had good hold on the subject. Among them, I found through live and piazza discussions, TA - Alex to be damn good in the subject.\r\n\r\nI feel it's important to mention that the solutions they would publish are simply beautiful. The solutions implemented by Christoffer Dall were mesmerizing. No, am not exaggerating at all - his coding style is so pleasing to eye and his code looks very simple and precise!\r\n\r\nPeer reviews: Yes, you would get opportunities(or responsibilities?) to review and grade other people's code. Here, I was annoyed at certain times of seeing some seriously senseless code from other people. At other times, I had also the chance to look at some brilliant code. So, overall, there was a good exchange of knowledge and suggestions between our team and various teams.\r\n\r\nYeah, btw, try to form a good competent team - believe me, it's better to have arguments and come up with some kick-ass code which scores beyond the average code resulting from an average interaction or no interaction at all between you and your teammates.

It will have you thinking differently about all sorts of problems.  The other great thing about the class is how I always left the discussions wanting to work on the project - unlike most classes where the assignments are fairly arbitrary, you have a great deal of leeway in the deliverable, and typically you have something you want to try.\nI would recomend this class to anybody who feels comfortable with a discussion-\noriented problem-solving case study.\n\nAlso, I would reccomend Professor Ross' databases course - he is an excellent professor.",

Also bear in mind that all members of a group receive the same grade, and there is no formal peer review process.\n\nI still recommend this course; it has several important merits that others have mentioned, and what you learn in it will stay relevant long after you forget the intricate details of distributed transactions or lambda calculus.  If you put in the work, you will walk away content unless, like me, you don't suffer fools gladly.  If you don't put in the work, you will still do relatively well at the expense of those who do.",

The class is more than a standard db offering in terms of workload: you got to do two projects, a web based db app and another theory-type number cruncher (most db classes make you do that one big app as a term project). There's also homeworks, mostly easy, with an occasional twist. If you go to class, do the projects/homework and score above avg in the exams, you're guaranteed a B+. One caution sign I'd post is: don't ignore the prereqs. You *need* to know how to code, and you *need* to know some data structure stuff. Don't screw around on this one, or you'll run into trouble in the projects. Gravano is basically a good guy. He does his best to help you out (even tho he appears touchy in class when cellphones ring, laptops ping etc, and you got to get used to the self-deprecating humor bit.) He's cool in office hours and email too (he gave several important hints on the second project ... this was a *huge* help after I spent like a whole weekend going blind on the numbers.)

The second half deals with DB I/O cost analysis, and was difficult enough for Prof. Gravano to turn into - take your pick - Derridean post-modern literary theory or Martian rocket science. Even in the project assignments the most obvious concepts were mangled into research paper theory filler - my project team mate, who sailed through the course, kept wondering why on earth the guy would go to such lenghts to turn the clear and easy into the hermetic and impossible. \n\nAgain, I never had any doubt that Prof. Gravano was putting more than enough effort on the class, considering that as a top scientist on the field he had a busy enough schedule, but the obscurity of his explanations made lectures a tough going, until by the second half he was making jokes about everyone falling asleep. The blank looks he was getting by then contrasted with the sincere interest everyone had on the course material before the midterm, when his challenges and questions started such debates, he had to stop and ask people to quiet down. \n\nThis is one of the few courses in which the difficult textbook proves more useful than the overflowing PP slides or the teacher's talk. The TA I was assigned for the project appeared to get kicks out of taking points for the most trivial mistakes, but then again, it is difficult to blame the teacher for such things - in fact he was the one who had to ask her to take it easy with the grading.

      "review_text": "This is an acceptable course, but I have mixed feelings about it. Let's establish some baseline. Dr. Gravano is undoubtedly a capable lecturer, able to explain concepts lucidly. He occasionally told jokes that made the classroom laugh (sometimes). I'm pretty certain he genuinely cares for his students. You will almost certainly learn a lot of new and useful stuff while taking this course. Overall, the course was planned and executed well.\r\n\r\nIf you are on the NLP or ML track \u2013 or you have a strong interest in search engines or big data, you should certainly take this course. This course definitely falls squarely in that domain (I mean hey, the free textbook was on the NLP part of Stanford's website...). I suspect the facts you will learn will be very relevant to you. However, if you are on the software track taking this course just because it has good reviews and fulfills a requirement, I'd suggest giving other courses stronger consideration. I don't exactly regret taking this class, but I think I could have chosen better.\r\n\r\nDr. Gravano curves the median to a B+ or A-. You may be thinking \u201cSure, I'll just score above average!\u201d but in a 90 something class full of smart people and easy assignments and tests, this is tricky to do \u2013 and there is a good component of luck involved.\r\n\r\nThe two tests which comprise 50% of your grade are themselves comprised of about 40% (each) true false questions. That's 20% of your grade roughly!  I felt that some of them were vaguely worded and it's pretty hit or miss if you remember the specific fact the question tests you on.\r\n\r\nYou'll either need a very good memory or be very planned and careful how you review the lectures, because you really could get tested on any bullet point in them. It's fair and doable, but that's not my style. I'd rather be tested on my ability to apply what I learned to solve problems than my ability to simply remember details about stuff I could recall by referring to the textbook or my notes (neither of which are allowed on the exams).  Oh, and the readings are often straight torture. Thankfully, I don't ever remember seeing a question that was in the reading but not the lecture. Much of the writing was by authors showing off their ability to encrypt simple concepts into Latex strings. Dr. Gravano's lectures blew the textbook out of the water.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the tests involve manually carrying out an algorithm he discussed in the lecture. The tests are easy, but I'm really not a fan of easy tests because mistakes will cost you a lot more. But that's obviously my opinion... you might think otherwise. \r\n\r\nThe HWs (java or python) certainly aren't trivial, but they aren't complicated either. The class generally averaged 9/10 on them with a very small standard deviation. I think I learned more about Python than I did about search algorithms or the subject matter of the class while doing the assignments. The first and last project implemented an algorithm that is probably only a step or two above the complexity of what you would encounter in an undergraduate data structures class at a reasonably competitive school. The second project mostly involved string formatting and learning how to use the API to google's open knowledge database. Personally, I found it pretty tedious. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say the assignments can be finished in two days. The API in the second project took forever to figure out, but I'd really rather invest my energy somewhere other than learning an API I won't use again in the foreseeable future. \r\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is not a bad class. Good for some people, less so for others. As you can tell by the other positive reviews, some folks do enjoy it. I see where they are coming from. Some of the things I don't like about the class are a matter of personal taste. I hazard to say you will likely get your tuition's worth on this class. If you are NLP or ML I think you almost certainly will. I'm just saying this class isn't for everyone.",

I had no previous programming experience, but I decided to stay in CS1007 because I knew that I would learn more in that class. Prof. Cannon said that students without prior programming experience would find the class difficult (even those who had a lot of programming experience had a hard time), but the class is do-able and Prof. Cannon made sure to say that he would be as supportive as he can.  And he was.  He also made class fun -- he is funny and witty and actually makes you want to go to class (and you should go.  Many times he covered concepts that weren't in the textbook, and we needed to know those concepts for the exams and to complete our homework assignments).\n\nIf you're looking for an easy A in computer science, then CS1007 is not for you.  Take Professor Cannon's advice and take CS1004 (though I'm not sure what the workload is in that class.  I know it's easier than 1007, though).

Such hint is so useful when you are bombarded with tons of vocabs and info that you encounter in the textbook; because then you know which the primary and important stuff are and which are not. Also, he explicitly provided studying strategies for the midterm, which, of course, can be used in other classes. However, I didn't find him all that helpful when it came to seeing him during office hours or through email; so I got help the TA's who were simply great (I had Rachel Goldman, Cheryl Lau, and Lauren Wilcox).

I would recommend this course to any strong student up for a challenge, even one who does not need COMS as a requirement.  Professor Cannon says it is not easy and tells us which assignments are especially hard, but CS will teach you a new way of thinking about the world.  Professor Cannon covers the basics of both hardware (the physical structure of the computer) and programming, so by the time you're done with the course you will probably know which topic you like better.  Lectures supplemented the readings and helped clarify which aspects of the materials were the most important.  One of Professor Cannon's strengths was making complicated concepts understandable.  He is willing to go over the same idea more than once, even at the expense of glossing over a few simpler programming concepts that I would have liked the lectures and assignments to cover a bit more thoroughly.  The final was DEFINITELY harder than the midterm, although neither was excessively difficult.\r\n\r\nIt's a good idea for people without a very strong programming/hardware background to take W1004--you learn quite a bit about both and are a much more fluid programmer by the time you reach the more advanced courses.  Professor Cannon was very good at introducing us to the academic organizations and resources the CS department offers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there are many TAs means that you should be able to come to a good TA's office hours (in my experience, decent to good TAing was the rule rather than the exception).

The texts for the class are pricey so get them from a friend or rent them if possible. Only one of the two, Big Java, will really be useful after the course is over, so if there's one to buy, that's it.

The satisfaction of realizing the efficiency and power of a program you've just designed and built is unbelievable after you've spent hours debugging it.

The problem sets are generally pretty simple and graded fairly, with the programming assignments much harder but graded fairly easily. The midterm and final were extremely easy, and the class is curved to something like a B+ average."

Plus Cannon always goes on random CS-related tangents every once in a while and these are generally fun and informative.\r\n\r\nAs for the class, it's got two components; theory (Intro to CS) and programming (Intro to Java). Theory and programming homeworks alternate from week to week. Theory homeworks are not too bad, they can be done just from reading the relevant chapters in the book. Programming ones can be challenging and take varying amounts of time (depending on who you are) but you will certainly learn how to program at the end of it.\r\n\r\nMidterm and final aren't all that bad if you've been keeping up with the lectures and the homeworks. They're a bit on the memorization side of things - especially the final which asked some pretty obscure questions which is why it's good to attend lecture because he often mentions random things that I noticed ended up on the test.\r\n\r\nI should mention that although this is intro CS, it's a pretty high level intro so don't take the class for the granted - you'll have to put in some work to get an A.\r\n\r\nAlso there are lots of office hours and for the most part the TAs are great so I would highly recommend popping in if you have question regarding your assignment; even if you code works, you might wanna just make sure with the TAs that your design, etc. is okay.",

He cursorily goes over TONS material which he seems not to have mastered well himself, but succeeds at covering it up. He assigns EXTREMELY long problem sets that are proof heavy. Attending class was a major time-sink as he would be late for class, his lectures were unorganized and his class examples trivial, not helpful at all when it came to doing the problem sets.Though discrete math is a useful class, I disagree it is the most important (as Cannon appears convinced) and he should be more considerate of this view.\r\nThe midterm for the class was fair, but the final impossible. Of the many faults Cannon's teaching style has, the worst is probably the fact that the final is cumulative, with approximately 700 pages worth of material--including over 300 vocabulary words and proofs--to know by heart. \r\nStrongly consider taking discrete math with another teacher.",

Cannon was also able to effectively condense a 800 page textbook into only a notebook of notes.

First, whether or not Adam Cannon taught the class well, and second whether or not it was hard and time-consuming.\r\n\r\nI can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the class and, as usual, found Adam Cannon to be an engaging and witty lecturer. It is true, he wasn't on cruise control as he is while teaching 1004, but he was still very good. His explanations were intuitive and clear and he realized that most people taking the class had not had previous exposure to a higher level of mathematics. As a result, he time again emphasized and explained to us, the importance of thinking truly mathematically as it were. In other words, he taught us to recognize the importance and place of proofs in mathematics and stated that while examples are often helpful, they are simply not adequate to understand abstract concepts completely. He sometimes proved theorems which were not in the book, so be aware of that and occasionally makes notational mistakes on the board so don't be afraid to point them out as he often doesn't notice them afterwards. I felt lost in only one of the lectures which was the one on solving liner homogeneous and non-homogeneous recurrence relations, I don't know what happened there but it seemed like Adam Cannon was having a monologue with the board for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn class, he asks interesting puzzles related to the material and will always give you an idea about the real-world applications of the concepts being covered. He is also just friendly and approachable. He has 4 office hours a week, which is more than most professors, although there is often a line so go early. Definitely go to office hours if you get stuck on the homeworks, he's more than happy to help. He'll rarely give away an answer but will certainly tell you how to approach any given problem.", 
      "workload_text": "6 homeworks assignments in the semester - we had 2 weeks to complete each assignment. They were pretty long in an absolute sense, but given that we had two weeks to solve them, the length was by no means unreasonable. A quarter to a third of the problems in each assignment were proofs but most of these followed almost straightaway from the definitions. Writing proofs was hard at first for some people, but then again learning how to write basic proofs is half the point of the class. The bulk of the time-consuming problems are in the earlier part of the assignment so you can get started early during the 2 week period. One thing I did find was that the point distributions on the homeworks could be bizarre and some hard problems had very few points assigned to them. Also the TAs sometimes graded kind of harshly so if you think they overlooked something and your solution was correct, definitely go back to them and ask.\r\n\r\nMidterm was easy, the 2 proofs were perhaps the only tricky part. The final was cumulative and the questions were difficult. Lots of counting problems, 4 proofs  (3 of them manageable) and some modular arithmetic. 20 points is testing vocabulary so these are basically free points and you have to learn the definitions anyway in order to do well on the proofs. It also doesn't take all that long. According to him, the class is curved to a high B so about 30-40% of people get some sort of an A."

While his lectures aren't always structured like they're coming from an outline you can copy down, they aren't boring and they do get the information across.

If it were that easy, it wouldn't be a problem that you needed to learn how to solve.  When he lectures, he doesn't just go A-B-C-D-E, he tries to get you to think about the process behind getting to E.\r\n\r\nThe class covered a lot of material very fast, and it definitely helped if you had a rudimentary familiarity with things like statistics, logic, and counting.

He seems to have an ordered list of a dozen or so things to get through each lecture, and will work through them.   He does enjoy occasional diversions to related topics.  He clearly likes the material and manages to keep what could be a very dry topic interesting.  He welcomes questions, and is one of the best professors I've seen at being able to explain concepts multiple ways when people don't grasp them.  If you ask a stupid question, he won't sugar-coat his response, but he won't out-right mock you either.  And in one-on-one interactions, he's great.  Very approachable.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, he was usually 5 minutes late to class, and there was a very long lag time for homework to be graded and returned.\r\n\r\nAnd he LOVES his definitions.

This class gives you a great overview of Computer Science, and an unmatched introduction to programming. Somehow Cannon manages to fit in a ton of material while still giving a good sense of each topic. The only exception to this would be the section of the class on computer networks, which I honestly feel could have been narrowed down to just the information about internet protocols. \r\n\r\nLearning object-oriented programming has a learning curve, but once you've got it, you're just coasting from then on.

Nonetheless, Cannon and the TAs make themselves pretty available to you, and the assignments are not unreasonable.

Programming takes probably 10ish hours. The singular most important advice is go to the TA office hours. There are like 8 TAs for the class.

      "review_text": "Adam Cannon is a pretty solid teacher. He knows his stuff, and is very organized when teaching. With this in mind, Intro to Java is probably one of the most challenging and time-consuming classes offered at Columbia. Unless you have to take this class for your major, be sure you REALLY want to take this class. There are much easier ways to learn coding and Java. When Cannon tells you at the beginning that this class will take at least 10 hours of work per week, he is telling the truth. Many times, the work requires a lot more than 10 hours/week. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot of information that Cannon tries to teach in this course. You will learn both theory and programming in this class. Because of the amount of info he tries to teach, Cannon skips over a lot of basic stuff that he expects you to learn on your own. I had no experience in programming coming in so I wish he would not have skipped over stuff. For this reason, I would only recommend this class to someone who has some experience or background in coding. Talking to many who were in the same boat as me, we had to play catch-up throughout the semester. This class is already considered difficult to those with coding backgrounds, so it makes life even more miserable when you have to put even more work into an already difficult class.\r\n\r\nThe TAs for the class are usually pretty helpful. I would recommend getting help from the TA that grades your assignments since some of the grading, especially the written assignments, can be very subjective. I also went to Cannon's office hours. He does not come off as the nicest or most personable person ever, but he does try to help you out. He definitely does not try or care to get to know students (at least in this class). I will give him props for his cheesy jokes that lighten up the class.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you really have to decide if you are willing to do the work for the class. If you just want to take this class because you think coding will be \"fun\" to learn, do not take the class. Learn coding on your own at a pace where it can be fun, exciting, and addictive. Besides those who are majoring in CS, only those who are serious about learning Java and the theory of programming in a rigorous and often cutthroat setting should take this class.",

      "review_text": "First off, there are 2 types of people that take this class: those who have programmed before, and those who have never programmed before in their life.  If you fall into the latter group, like myself, I HIGHLY recommend reading up a bit on Python before you take the class because the learning curve is steep.  This review will come from the perspective of someone with no former programming experience:\r\n\r\nIntro to Comp Sci for Eng/App Sci is still in its 3rd year of infancy, so Adam Cannon is still developing the curriculum for this class.  Adam Cannon is a really nice guy who often makes the types of sardonic jokes that provoke a chuckle or two, verbally assumes that his class hates him, and gives riddles at the beginning of class to those students who already know the material and can afford to spend the duration of class pondering the riddle, life itself, or if they should attend the next class.  Lectures consisted of him going through topics rather rapidly (for someone who knows nothing of Python) and explaining examples of programs posted in CourseWorks.  For people with programming experience, the feeling of rushing may not have been the case, but some topics he introduced--especially for the homework--could be quite challenging.  We did not have a textbook, which I think would have been helpful, but I believe he is getting one next semester.  Often in class, Professor Cannon would ask if there were any questions and be greeted by silence and blank stares, to which he would respond, \"If 1 of you doesn't understand something, that means 10 more of you don't understand it either,\" sigh, and move on, so ASK QUESTIONS if you don't understand something.  Those afraid to ask questions will be extremely grateful that you did.\r\n\r\nHomework consists of bi-weekly projects that can be very tricky, so try not to procrastinate on these because Professor Cannon will answer questions about/go over the homework in class sometimes.  That being said, he will not baby you and give you the answer, only try to lead you on a path to finding the right answer, both in class and in office hours.  The TAs are all awesome and extremely nice (even if they are all really busy), and I highly recommend going to their office hours.  Both the midterm and final are written and doable, but you should study for them, no matter what programming background you have.  Overall, although this can be a challenging class, Adam Cannon is a satisfactory teacher, but it is up to you--the student--to ask him for help if you need it.",

He knows his stuff, and while excuses have to be made since this is only the 3rd year this course exists, he is still refining the curiculum. However, while the cotent of the lectures was interesting (read: sometimes, other times not falling asleep was hard) they were only vaguely related to the homework, and most of the time, were it not for online documentation on Python, me and all my friends in the class would have failed. Although he leaves time in lecture for questions, his sometimes sarcastic answers and interactions with students discourage many from asking. Oftentimes, he will not actually answer the question posed in class, just tells you to \"deal with it\" in a roundabout way, or gives a non-sensical answer. His office hours dont help: although he holds the same amount of office hours as other professors, he is teaching about 400 students at a time, so there is always at least a 10-20 student line waiting to talk to him during office hours. To be fair though, there are about 5 TAs, though they often are not clear on the specific requirements of the assignment and will sometimes give you wrong information if you ask a mildly specific/complex question on the problem sets. Desperate emails sent the day before the homework is due dont get answered until after the dealine (though to be fair, he warned us that he would take minumum 1 or 2 days to respond due to the impressive amount of emails he gets). \r\n\r\nOverall, although Cannon is a good teacher, he is not good for this course. The learning curve is very slow for the first 3 weeks, and gets incredibly hard after that. While about half the students in the class have programmed before, for the half who have not, the problema set take significantly more hours tan the 8-12 Cannon gives as reference. So start early. DO NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE OR YOU WILL NOT FINISH. \r\n\r\nAvoid this class unless you actually have to take it or you are pursuing a mayor/minor/concentration/ect in computer science or related fields.

The programming component isn't related to the assignments at all but to the simple principles of object-oriented programming. The other component was mostly memorization.

      "review_text": "I imagine this class would be very difficult to succeed in with no programming background.  I took AP Computer Science in high school, so I expected Cannon's class to be cake.  However, it still did require a good deal of effort and I felt appropriately challenged throughout the semester.  As past reviewers have mentioned, the learning curve is pretty steep, with problem set 1, and programming projects 2-4 being among the most stressful.  Cannon is not kidding when he says that the programming projects will require 10+ hours of work -- they really do!  Your best bet would be to start early on the projects and attend TA office hours whenever you hit a major rut.  \r\n\r\nLectures are helpful, but only as a brief summary of what you need to know.  To rely on lectures alone would leave you poorly prepared for the assignments in this class, but I think that for any technical class this goes without saying.  The two recommended textbooks are both very good resources and will be relied on heavily throughout the course.  I found that the lectures and problem sets were representative of exam content.  The programming projects, however, were not.  \r\n\r\nThe class is well organized, with a very clear outline of covered topics and assigned grading groups to expedite grading.  There is an entire army of TAs who rotate on a schedule to grade your problem sets/programming projects and who send you detailed grade reports VIA lionmail (more on the TAs later...).\r\n\r\nOverall, I think the course does a good job at its ambitious task of introducing students to the fundamentals of computer science and programming in Java.  In addition, you will also be introduced to software like: Pico, CUnix, CyberDuck, Eclipse, Vagrant VirtualBox (maybe), and Gimp.  Professor Cannon has a good sense of humor and tries to make even the duller aspects of computer science interesting.  If you commit yourself to doing all the work, the takeaway is enormous.  My only major complaint:\r\n\r\nTHE TAs (well, some of them):\r\n\r\nThe TAs are a mixed lot.  Some are truly wonderful and are willing to help you with all your NullPointerExceptions, while others seem plain butthurt about losing points for inane reasons back when they were COMS W1004 students.  Between the 6 problem sets and 5 programming projects, you'll come into contact with at least 11 of the TAs.  \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, your grade reports are sent to your lionmail by your TA of the week.  Frequently, students will respond to the grade report emails to ask for suggestions or for a more detailed explanation of how to improve code.  As I have heard from other students, and as I have experienced myself, this sometimes results in the TAs correcting your grade to a lower score.  What I mean is this: when the TA sees your grade report again in your reply email, they might see that they made a mistake in grading you and then will lower your score by the appropriate amount.  \r\n\r\nUntil the TAs start grading things without error, or until some sort of \"grade-is-set-after-sending-to-student\" policy is put into place, you should not ask the TA who graded you for pointers.  I repeat DO NOT ASK THE TA WHO GRADED YOUR ASSIGNMENT ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT--THEY MIGHT SPOT SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T TAKE OFF POINTS FOR AND THEN PROCEED TO TAKE OFF POINTS FOR IT.\r\n\r\nTo me this seems rather messed up.  Isn't the best person to learn from the professional who was paid to read through every line of your code?  As things currently are, it is impractical to talk to this person because they could easily spot a mistake in their grading and then make a last-minute change on CourseWorks.  In no other class I've ever taken in my academic career have assignment grades been so impermanent.  I overheard other students in the help room speak of \"avoiding\" the TA that graded their most recent assignment in fear that they could have points deducted.  I hate to think I could have done better in this class by NOT asking the person who graded my assignment for help...",

DO YOU INTEND TO LEARN THAT AFTER PAYING SO MUCH in this course at COLUMBIA ...an Ivy league university?\r\nYou will be made to produce a paper for mid term that constitutes half of your whole semester grade. This paper can be on any topic that you like and TA JON Bell likes. Oh good lord behold...if you did not write a paper in 2-3 weeks that is good enough to please \"Jonathan Bell\"...my my....you are getting a C for sure. You might think how is that possible, afterall you did every possible shit they asked you to do...like making 15 pages report. keeping font of this SIZE, SPACING between lines, inserting proper images as they asked ...cite them well.....with special reference method....they asked....still you get a fucking C or B- in paper grade. Afterall thats what  you paid for to learn at Columbia? (Do some scaling, lining, put references etc..and let prof speak some history for half a semester....) If you by chance happen to visit Jonathan Bell and ask for why you got a C or B or something in between, he will search through that report and say, your heading was bold when it should have been italic..or your paper is not strongly supporting this or that.....what the fuck...?You paid tuition for that?and after NOT LEARNING ANYTHING FOR A SEMESTER...you get a C to B. Another half of semester you will end up doing some project OF YOUR CHOICE and demoing in class what you did etc. TEACHER was suppose to teach and that never happened...and now you find yourself suddenly giving presentation in front of class on something....\r\n\r\nWaste of tuition and a poor grade. \r\nYou wont learn anything in this course, because she wont teach you. Moreover if you happen to not please them in presentation or in project, you will get a POOR GRADE that will cost you GPA and later jobs.\r\n\r\nJonathan Bell is an asshole TA who has a BIG EGO. He rejoices in screwing people's grades and nothing else. He can never agree to anything you say or propose. It should strictly adhere to what he thinks is best and what he likes. If that is not the case, you lose grade and points. Why does Columbia even allow Gail Kaiser to take classes? and what do students learn after taking her classes? All her courses share same story and I was victim....\r\nAtleast you dont become one....and please please drop this course....take something else somewhere if not at Columbia.....if you have to...but dont take this course....you will repent all your life for having taken this course under Gail Kaiser with Jonathan Bell as TA.\r\n",

You do surprisingly little coding, which is ironic for a \"software engineering\" course. Writing \"cool\" software won't score you more points in the class. If you absolutely must take this course, do not be ambitious about the projected you will create. You won't receive extra points because your project is \"cool\" or \"harder.\" Most of your grade hangs on the writing/documentation you do -- and you will spend more time on this than anyone would want to. So make your software easy to document and easy to test. You really only spend a month or two working on it, the rest is over-excessive planning you don't end up following anyway.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final will have you writing so much stuff! The first of the three questions test you on vocabulary (!) terms from the lectures/book. The second one is short answers. The last one asks you to come up with designs for proposed software and ask you to write more than what most people can do in the given time. If you take this course, do the test backwards. Almost everything in the course is pedestrian stuff you know already: unit tests, version control, software testing, etc. The other stuff you might not have heard of, UML diagrams, burn-down charts, and spike testing, etc, are not complicated at all, and can easily be learned from the textbook. (http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Software-Development-Pilone/dp/0596527357). In undergrad, I went to a much less prestigious school than Columbia, and I never had a course this boring, simple, and tedious. I was really in for a surprise.\r\n\r\nThe redeeming feature of the course is that the teacher an the TAs (the one's we had) were all nice people. (not necessarily easy graders though!) The textbook is actually read from cover to cover and is actually affordable. However, you shouldn't take a course just because the textbook is cheap and the teacher is nice.\r\n\r\nI was initially attracted to this course because I thought I would spend most of the time coding a cool project. I ignored the negative reviews. I regret it. Don't make the same mistake.",

      "review_text": "I took this course with Edwards and Martha Kim in Fall 2012.\r\n\r\nThis is a review of Edwards.\r\n\r\nHis slides are simple and informative.  His lecture style is very straightforward: he is one of the most rational and simplistic presenters of complex material I have ever encountered.  If I had to take PLT, I would do so with Edwards.  He introduces LogiSim, which Rubenstein does not.  I told several of Rubenstein's students about LogiSim and it made their lives much easier.\r\n\r\nBut really I'm writing this review because of Edwards' personality and humor.\r\n\r\nEdwards is a geek's geek.  Perhaps he doesn't look like one, but he dresses like one and behaves like one.  I find this enjoyable in a professor, but for some it may be an acquired taste, like Scotch whiskey.\r\n\r\nSome co-engineers of mine have pointed out that he can be rude, surly, and dismissive.  I think these attributes seem to present themselves because he is rational above all else, and has a limited amount of time.  (~2 orders of magnitude below Temple Grandin. Let's say the average engineer is about 4 below, Vallancourt is 6 below, and the average art history major is 10 below.)\r\n\r\nI don't think he has ever been rude to me, but in the sense of being hyper-analytical without regard to feelings, Edwards has a tendency to do this.  And I personally find it liberating, assuming I am capable of keeping my ego out of the equation.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say he equates human interactions to a set of logic gates, but in dealing with assignments and career advice, don't expect a lot of small talk or beating-about-the-bush.  Professor Edwards is one of the most direct human beings I have ever encountered.\r\n\r\nIf you need to prove to yourself that he has a soft/creative/dynamic side, keep in mind the following:\r\n\r\n * He modeled for McDonald's in Taiwan\r\n * He bought a vintage PacMan arcade machine and drove it to his office from AC\r\n * He makes bad jokes that pertain to driving even though no one drives in New York\r\n * He wears a fanny pack when he bicycles to and from Mudd\r\n\r\nI may not be the most adept engineer in SEAS, but I thoroughly appreciate Edwards' awkward and dryly amusing brand of brilliant.\r\n",

      "review_text": "This review is for Edwards and for the SUMMER version of PLT. There is no summer review of him on here so for those of you who were curious, read on!\r\n\r\nEdwards is, plain and simple, the shit. He is quite possibly the most organized professor I have ever seen. His website contains every class of PLT he has taught for the most part including old projects, slides, and documents. Furthermore, his notes are outstanding. In that regard, he has basically done all the work for you. The material is complex at heart but his notes and his descriptions in class make that material very easy to digest. Furthermore, it is evident in every shape and form that he absolutely loves and cares about the material. This man is among the nerdiest to ever exist and he definitely knows his stuff inside and out and forwards and backwards and I feel like he was very effectively in conveying this passion in his lectures. In addition to learning about making a language, you will also learn cool tidbits like C history, language history, or operational details you might not have known about various languages. Edwards is also a total language hipster and spent the first day of class openly trashing Java, C++, and many others (he called Perl an \"abomination\"). Therefore, if you are waiting for his endorsement of the \"cool and underground language you haven't heard of, maaaaaan\" then you will find it with OCaml (more on that in a second).\r\n\r\nThe summer class had two homeworks which were both incredibly easy. The notes will tell you everything you need to know and he doesn't pull any cheap shots; if you pay attention in class and understand the notes then you will be able to breeze through the assignments.\r\n\r\nHowever, the homeworks are only 10 percent of your grade. A whopping 50 percent of your grade comes from a massive project wherein you have to make your own programming language. The other 40 comes from the final exam (no midterm) which, while a little tricky, wasn't too bad.\r\n\r\nThe project itself MUST be done in a language called OCaml which I had never heard of before taking this class. OCaml is quite possibly the most annoying language you will ever use if only because it has the most frustrating and nitpicking compiler I have ever seen......but the good news is that most of the time once it compiles then it works the way you want it to. Personally, I prefer to write code that blows up, analyze it, and then fix it (and isn't that the purpose of test suites anyway?) but you will have no such luxury with OCaml. Furthermore, it has very unhelpful error messages; it is fairly difficult to ascertain the problem when the only indication of what you did wrong is something like \"Syntax Error\" or \"Expression was 'a * 'b * 'c but was expecting type 'a * 'b list\" (and what the fuck exactly is a 'b list?!?!? I just finished the class and I still don't know). If you thought \"Segmentation Fault\" was bad just wait until you get a load of this. Still, Edwards makes the point that OCaml is an easy language to write compilers in and once you start getting good at it you will see where he is coming from. The language itself is fairly powerful and you can do quite a lot with only a few lines. As annoying as OCaml was I am glad that we had to use it if only to a) learn a new language and b) gain the new perspective and discipline from programming in it. It is also interesting to learn a new language when taking a class dissecting what makes a language \"good\".\r\n\r\nSTART EARLY ON THE PROJECT. The class is 6 weeks long and goes by faster than you'd ever believe. My team and I were pretty good at staying on point throughout but I can very easily see how the project can be a nightmare if you wait until the last minute and doubly so if the team hasn't practiced with OCaml. There were other teams demoing with barely finished languages who appeared to make that mistake; don't let it be you.\r\n\r\nThe only complaint I have about this class is the time we spent covering Prolog. While it is an interesting language to learn about, I don't know why he spent the time he did covering unification and searching considering AI is already a class here. This part of the class seemed completely out of place and irrelevant next to anything else we had done all summer. There was even a Prolog question on the final exam. It seemed rather pointless to have this question on the final, which is supposed to test my knowledge of programming languages and translators, covering an AI topic and making it worth 10 points.\r\n\r\nLastly, a word of warning: Edwards is a very direct person and is quick to criticize or otherwise shoot down your ideas for your project. Don't take it personally. At first he hated my idea too.", 
      "workload_text": "Homeworks are both incredibly easy and are easily finished in a day. Yes, drawing automata can be time consuming but it isn't hard to do.\r\n\r\nThe project itself isn't too bad. My team was able to do it in 6 weeks. If we can do that then there's no reason for you to fear it. As long as you coordinate effectively with your team and you don't procrastinate it's a breeze. I can see how the contrary can easily become a nightmare.\r\n\r\nLastly, I want to clear up the misconception that PLT is one of the hardest classes in CS here. That isn't true at all (at least not with Edwards). The key to success in this class lies, as opposed to many other classes I've taken at Columbia, entirely on you. You've got to put in the work but considering the time it isn't that bad and it will pay off.\r\n\r\nI would definitely recommend taking this over the summer if you can. "

      "review_text": "Stay away from Edwards, go with Aho. Edwards recommends Aho himself. Also, Aho's famous because he's the A in AWK and wrote the Dragon book. The only thing you'll miss in Aho's class is Edwards' sense of humor.\r\n\r\nEdwards is the snarkiest, most sarcastic, immature professor you will meet in the CS department. He tells some really great nerdy jokes and his Facebook wall is hilarious since he belittles all his students publicly on it, but I don't recommend taking his class. Don't ever email him with an excuse or stupid question since he will publicly shame you (name removed though) on Facebook.\r\n\r\nI didn't learn much in the course. The material was pretty straight forward, nothing really complicated like you would see in more theoretical CS classes. You sort of get a high level understanding of how a compiler works and that's about it. If you did most of the work for your project, you will learn more mostly by reading on your own to save your project and not because you learned anything from this class. \r\n\r\nHis exams are reasonably easy but the problem is everyone gets high scores. The median on the midterm was like a 94. If you screwed up even a little bit, you were done for. You don't have to know all the material in the slides - most of it is to build the compiler. He posts review slides the class before the exam. You just need to know the stuff on them. Check out the last semester slides on his website to peek ahead. Grading was harsh and he often cuts points for really dumb reasons. Make sure your HW is perfect if you want a good score.\r\n\r\nThe project is KILLER. In all likelihood, you will fail if you don't assemble the Avengers to be your team. Make sure you put together a strong team which has time to commit to this project. The project is structured such that one person (the most responsible or the least busy) always ends up doing over 50% of the work. We've looked at other groups and previous teams and this is the case through out. I think Edwards should take a look at this and somehow fix the project so that it's more fair.\r\n\r\nSome tips: Start early!!! Get the scanner and parser out of the way quickly. You can copy most of them from last year's groups and just modify them to your liking. He doesn't really teach you enough to write the compiler till 3/4ths of the way into the semester but don't wait for that since you'll get screwed. Semantic checking and code generation take a ton of time to complete. Start early and be sure to pester the TAs for help. Also, half of you team will be slackers and you will lose all faith in humanity. You just have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't make expectations on the project clear at all, so I'm going to break it down for you here. You need to turn in your proposal 2-3 weeks into class. Get started with the scanner and parser ASAP. Then turn in your language reference manual which says what your language will look like. Then code up the rest of your compiler and put together some tests. Our group ended up writing 70% of our language during reading week and finishing the slides for our final presentation and the project report during finals week. Needless to say, my other exams got screwed in the process.",

The course revolves around the idea of teaching a computer to extract information from visual images, such as the position of an object, the position of edges, shape/depth of a scene from multiple images. Some of it will make you rethink the many things we as humans take for granted, and Shree likes to insert pertinent biological/philosophical/tech-biz tidbits that encourage an appreciation for the material beyond a purely CS perspective. The underlying theory could potentially get very mathematical, but Shree avoids that and focuses instead on the general ideas and principles. In sum, the subject material is interesting, challenging at times but rarely impossible.  As a teacher, Shree is one of the best out there. He is entertaining, funny, and very dedicated to making sure we learn. He is also a very effective lecturer with excellent presentation. So, although he is quite a busy man (a lot of conferences to attend) and had the TAs teach a couple of classes, I feel that we learnt more in his classes than usual.  All in all, a great experience and highly recommended.",

He provides the class with handouts containing almost every slide he uses (yes, he uses slides on a projector, which is usually a bad sign, but he pulls it off well)... over 400 pages per student across the term.  This minimizes how much you have to take down in terms of notes, and allows you to spend more of the lecture making sure you understand, rather than copying down diagrams.\nI have to agree with the previous review: Professor Nayar's digressions are always interesting, and regardless of whether they help understand the material, they help understand the motivations, or how vision works in humans.\nIt's not an easy class, but if you come to lecture all the time and pay attention, you shouldn't have trouble with the homeworks... \nthe midterm and final may be a different matter though.

Great lecturing style, clearly super intelligent, and genuinely does his best to make sure we understand the material. That said, we cover a lot of material in this class, and preparing for the exams is hellish. The exams generally cover some of the easier concepts in the class, but it's also easy to lose points on proofs and there are also quite a few questions where you just have to remember a specific detail or some model which you otherwise can't derive on the spot. No way around some of this stuff unless you put a lot of time into memorization of the material.\r\n\r\nHomeworks are great! They're done in MATLAB now (I think he said they were in C until a couple years ago), so they're constantly evolving - Nayar admits as much himself, especially that he put a lot more material in the class and on the HWs this semester. This is not a class you want to procrastinate on (nor can you afford to). If you start the night before, you may stay up all night, and just not be able to finish due to the difficulty of some of these homeworks. You should start at least a few days before so you have time to consult the TAs because you will inevitably run into MATLAB bugs, amongst other issues with understanding the Vision algorithms themselves.\r\n\r\nYou should probably attend every class because Professor Nayar doesn't post any of the material on courseworks. The TAs print out all the lecture slides and you pick up one of these packets at the beginning of each class. These are literally just printouts of the slides, so you'll want to take miscellaneous notes and comments based on what the professor says while presenting each slide.\r\n\r\nWe didn't receive any information about the distribution of grades this semester, so I can only comment that my grade was definitely lower than expected. A few people have said the same thing about their grades, but we can't make any generalizations. Just know it's a hard class - if you get a low grade, don't worry too much about it because this is one of the best, most useful classes you'll take in the CS@CU department, from one of the best professors around.",

Whether it's MATLAB vectorization or clever use of convolutions, you have to think things through pretty well to attain top marks.

There were review classes in the lecture before the tests which were quite helpful, if at all you started preparing!\r\n\r\nIt helps to have a study group as making sense of each slide takes up a lot of time although everything seems like a breeze during the class. TA's were very helpful. Thomas was a little picky in giving points but used to explain important concepts easily. You won't understand where exactly you lost points but they do indicate the relevant challenge number. Though programming in MATLAB seems easy, debugging is a headache. Make sure you proceed step by step. Just a tip: avoid built in functions unless you are completely sure of what they return. Getting a working solution was not enough to secure full points. You need to provide a 'smart' solution.\r\n\r\nI was taking Computer Graphics along with it and I must say a lot of my fundamentals got cleared through this class.

But, after the first three or four weeks, we were often told to just look in the book to learn about any new concept. In fact, each new idea that was introduced was concluded with the words \"go look in the book.\" He gives affectations to being devoted to his students, and I remember going to office hours several times to ask about topics that weren't being elucidated particularly well by the book. Each time, he forgot my name, and at the end of the (short) conversation, his helpful response was -- guess what? -- \"go look in the book.\" This was irresponsible teaching, and he's able to get away with it because he is tenured and famed within his field. His teaching style would improve vastly if he could only say \"go look in the book\" in other ways, like \"refer to the book for more details\" or \"the book contains much more information on this topic\" or even \"read the book and it will explain this concept better than I can ever explain to you during this lecture.\" I took this class in Spring 2004, and I'm sadly still bitter about this class.

The final was exactly as long as the midterm (both were given during the regular 75-minute class period, and they had the same number of questions) yet it counts for twice as much.

I cannot stress this enough. If you go into his office hours not understanding something, you'll come out of it completely and utterly understanding the subject; end of story. He is TERRIFIC 1 on 1. The homeworks are incredibly hard, so I recommend checking in during his office hours to double-check your work (or ask for pointers -- no puns intended) before submitting.\r\n\r\nThe other: As I said, his homeworks are incredibly hard (think Discrete math, but far, far more difficult). One of the last problems he gave us included a proof that HE had made in 1993 or some such proving that the way that perl handled regular expression recognition was NP-complete (when he first proposed this... no one believed him until he proved it). There was no way I could have solved this problem without going to office hours. But moreover, with the possible exception of the aforementioned problem, his assignments, while hard, are pretty fun. I don't mean you'll think they are entertaining, but they are well structured, so they are informative, and if you end up understanding the problem, it really helps you get a comprehensive understanding of the material (which is great). He also gives out practice exams that are incredibly useful.

If, like me, you enjoyed Gross's digressions, you'll probably also enjoy accounts of evenings spent (no joke) playing violin concertos with the author of \"The Art of Computer Programming.\"\r\n\r\nYou, like Aho, should care deeply about the material.

If all you want to do is write Java programs to fit a spec, you shouldn't have bothered with college: the whole point of studying computer science at an institution like this one is to learn how to answer questions like the ones Aho asks, and, you know, do something interesting with your life.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I had a blast; if you like oddball teachers and hard problems you will too.",

I'm sure there are other people who feel differently, but this was my experience:\r\n\r\nLectures- Aho seems to think that the material is a lot easier than it actually is, often failing to adequately explain simpler concepts in favor of complex proofs, etc. that never appeared on homeworks or exams. This is probably due to the fact that he pretty much invented a lot of it; however, for most of us, this was our first experience with theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\nAho also just plainly isn't an engaging lecturer. Listening to him lecture is a lot like listening to your great-uncle drone on about the Great Buckwheat Shortage of '68 (if your great-uncle is a great storyteller, then ignore this). Occasionally, Aho will talk about having dinner with Stephen Wolfram or working with Kernighan and Ritchie at Bell Labs, which is always cool but doesn't necessarily make the class worth taking.\r\n\r\nHomeworks- hard, but doable. There were five problems per problem set. They were problems that you had to do out and solve, which turned out to be useless because:\r\n\r\nExams- both the midterm and final were 10 true/false questions (with brief explanation). I just don't understand how ten true/false questions can adequately assess your knowledge of CS Theory. For the midterm, I studied all the algorithms and the workings of automata, but I did poorly on the exam (far below average). Many of the T/F questions were tricky (average was a 45, std. dev. of 22).\r\n\r\nFor the final, I didn't bother to learn how to solve any problems or do any proofs, because I knew they weren't going to be on the exam. Didn't really know much about Turing Machines. Bad mindset, I know, but I just studied the general concepts and did much better than the class average (which was a 75).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion- my recommendation? Take this class with someone else. I was not impressed...I'm not trying to be disrespectful towards Aho, but he is a professor that should be known for his accomplishments, not his teaching ability. Apparently he got a Great Teacher Award from Columbia at some point, but I feel like that has a lot to do with his legacy.

We all left slightly sick to our stomachs and unlikely to try out sushi again anytime soon.\n\nYou won't get any big pictures here.  You won't learn about any actual protocols in use today.

In the introductory lecture, he spent a full five minutes explaining why the reviews of him that were posted on CULPA are unfair. \nWhile I've heard professors respond to CULPA reviews before, I've never seen anyone get so defensive about one. \nIt leaves you with the impression that he feels like he's got something to prove, which is unfortunate since he's not a bad teacher.\n\nUnfortunately, for all the time he spent preparing his defense of his CULPA reviews, he never really seemed to spend enough time preparing to teach the course. The fact that he doesn't like any of the books out there isn't by itself a problem, but he needs to understand that there are people who like to be able to use books as a reference, to supplement lectures. The fact that he didn't decide whether to teach the course top down or bottom up until the second lecture meant that he couldn't recommend a book that covers the material in the same order that he would. This meant that those of us who tried to use the book he suggested to help with the early material were stuck with references to things that wouldn't be covered until the end of the course. How difficult would it have been for him to take the time to make that decision just a few days earlier so that he could suggest a book that could complement his lectures?\n\nLikewise, despite requests from several students, he never produced any kind of schedule for the course. No one had any way of knowing what would be covered, when it would be covered, or when the assignments would be due. This was especially problematic around midterms, when people are trying to budget their time, and Rubenstein decided to give out the information pertinent to assignments at the very last minute.\n\nI don't have a problem with teaching networks from a theoretical perspective, but I wish he spent more time talking about networks early on and less time trying to justify his decision to teach the way he does. Furthermore, everyone in the class has already taken a stats course of some sort, since it's a prerequisite for the course. It really wasn't necessary to spend 3 lectures early on explaining about expected value, especially since there was no schedule that people who already understood stats could refer to so that they could skip the redundant sessions.\n\nThe assignments were the kicker. He's certainly not the first CS professor I've had who's extremely rigid about assignment deadlines, but usually the ones who are that rigid are obsessive compulsive about posting the assignments well in advance and making sure that the project specification is detailed enough to avoid problems. Instead, Rubenstein would give out assignments usually a day or three after he promised, only to have to go through several rounds of revisions to account for mutually contradictory requirements within the project. It's not that the assignments are bad, just that he doesn't seem to take enough prep time to really set them up properly ahead of time.\n\nAs for his exams, he takes great pride in making them hard, which is certainly his right. The trick is to understand that he'd always rather ask a question designed to trick people than directly test their understanding of the underlying concepts. While it's useful to understand the concepts, you need to go into his exams trying to find the places where he's trying to trip you up. Unfortunately, this means that performance on the tests is at least as much about your ability to outsmart Rubenstein as it is about whether or not you're learning about computer networks.\n\nAll told, don't go out of your way to take any classes with him. He's not bad at standing in front of a room and explaining things, but he seems thoroughly uninterested in spending sufficient time preparing to teach. As for the theoretical angle he likes to take, it's not as bad as the other review would indicate, I just wish he hadn't wasted everyone's time with remedial stats in order to do it.",

So, use office hours, study from the books often, and make sure you get everything clarified.\r\n\r\nAlso, he is very poor on expressing himself. On the final exam, one problem had a mistake in it because it was worded too awkwardly and ended up contradicting itself. This ended up being a big problem because we couldn't do much of the problem until the question was clarified. I ended up kinda guessing what he meant to ask.

      "review_text": "Professor Rubenstein tries to do a good job, but in the end his attempt at teaching networking is not very good.  There are a few ways he can improve this class.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he teaches the class from a very theoretical point of view.  Considering this course is described as an \u201cIntroduction to computer networks,\u201d he needs to focus less on the theory.  The theory he teaches is excessive to the point that it\u2019s hard for me to follow how the theory relates to networking in real life.  I don\u2019t have a problem with theory, but first I\u2019d like to learn something practical so that I know how to apply the theory.\r\n\r\nProf. Rubenstein clearly states that he does not follow the book.  I understand that many professors do not follow the book because they need to present material that relates more closely to the course.  Unfortunately, in this situation, it\u2019s a big mistake.  Based on the course description, the material in the book is better than what Prof. Rubenstein teaches.\r\n\r\nCompared to other classes, Prof. Rubenstein also puts a lot of weight on the mid-term and final.  Based on the amount of effort I\u2019ve had to put in to the homework and programming assignments, I think the assignments should be a larger factor in the overall grade.  He barely teaches anything in class on how to do the programming assignments.  This leaves students with a lot of work although it only counts for a small portion of the grade.\r\n\r\nI would\u2019ve liked to learn about networking in this class, but unfortunately it looks like all I\u2019ve learned is strange theory that I have no idea how to apply to real life.  I think Prof. Rubenstein could do a decent job teaching the course if he would just read the course description one more time and realize that he doesn\u2019t need to teach anything other than what\u2019s presented in the textbook.  Save the theory for a different class, don\u2019t give it to us in the introduction to networks class.\r\n",

His slides are gorgeous, his lectures are unfailingly clear, and he's eager to help out outside of class.\r\n\r\nApparently he's used to teaching by drawing everything on the blackboard, but he had rotator cuff surgery early in the semester and had to do everything via PowerPoint to avoid damaging the muscles. Surprisingly, I think this turned out to be a good thing. Once you get into some of the scarier-looking circuitry, I imagine that it's easy to make make mistakes drawing, and I'm certain that it takes forever. This way, we got straight to (relatively) error-free drawings and spent time talking about the big picture instead of worrying about which wires cross.\r\n\r\nThis is also one of those rare classes where the material is interesting without being difficult. Five or six people in the class got perfect scores on the midterm, and I suspect a similar number aced the final. I don't think it's that Rubenstein makes the tests too easy -- this is just really straightforward stuff.\r\n\r\nThe few complaints I have are relatively minor. I think he was still a little sensitive about the last time he taught this course (with reviews like those, who wouldn't be?) and made a point of stopping to make sure everybody was following. This was nice, but the endless refrain of \"are you with me? Raise your hand if you understand\" got a little irritating by the end of the semester. He also seemed to get a little bit confused by some of his own notes about pipelined architectures, but everything worked out in the end.\r\n\r\nIn short, don't be scared off by any review written before 2009. This is a good class with a good instructor, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Prof. Rubenstein for Fundamentals.\r\n\r\nA side note:\r\nThe class nominally requires two textbooks. You can get by without buying either, but your life will be a little easier if you get Patterson and Hennesy. Don't bother with Mano and Kime -- it's almost completely useless.",

      "review_text": "Overall, I think Daniel Rubenstein was an excellent professor. Specifically, the majority of his lectures were extraordinarily clear. He had well prepared slides for every class, often with plenty of well-chosen images from the textbooks, and spent most of the class time describing what was happening in the pictures. One of his greatest strengths was being able to clearly and succinctly describe and give insight into the functioning of a circuit or architecture. He was also unusually receptive to questions during class. By and large, the students asked thoughtful and helpful questions, and as a result, he was able to clarify almost all subtleties and potential pitfalls in the material. The lectures seemed all the more engaging and participatory as a result as well.\r\n\r\nAll this praise aside, I can how see professor Rubenstein may not be a good fit for every student. Specifically, to get the most out of this course, it is best to take a very active approach. I agree with a previous reviewer that \"it's best to ask a lot of questions and make sure to make it your responsibility to clarify all the material that is taught.\" As I mentioned above, one of the reasons that the professor was able to make the material so clear was that students asked questions whenever something was less than one hundred percent clear.\r\n\r\nAs for the course as a whole, it felt like a gradually unfolding adventure/mystery story. We took a thoroughly bottom-up approach, and starting from the absolute basics of binary logic, gradually added new layers of abstraction until we had essentially designed a computer out of nothing. I was always on the edge of my seat waiting to see how all the ideas we looked at unfolded and built on each other to eventually construct such an amazing machine. Some of the ideas we covered, such as latches and flip-flops, are so utterly brilliant that I think it is somewhat of a shame that we never considered the engineers and inventors who were responsible for them. More generally, I think the ideas we covered in the class could have put into a richer historical context.", 
      "workload_text": "My one complaint about the course was the appropriateness of the homework. The workload was relatively light, but the problems themselves could have been more interesting overall. A lot of the homework time was spent either doing tedious computations (multiplying numbers in floating point comes to mind), or delving into an annoying level of detail, such as describing what effect a small design change would have on dozens of instructions which were not all listed in the same place. He seemed to save the best questions for the two exams, both of which were fun as well as fair."

He is one of the best professors I have had at Columbia in CS. After having taken both Fundamentals and Networks with him, I highly recommend him.\r\n\r\nHis lectures are spread between writing on the board and going over lecture slides that the textbook made. Both are pretty good, but when he writes on the board, he can go really fast. If you don't want to fall behind in class when he's writing on the board, don't copy everything down (though I did, and I often got lost). Listen though and ask questions. The textbook might serve as a good resource. I referred to it several times, but you could probably get away with just using Wikipedia. There's no assigned reading but he does cover nearly everything in the textbook (and more).\r\n\r\nHomeworks are reasonable. The first two programs are the hardest, but after that they just get easier (and even easier still). Do yourself a favor and do them in Java, trying to do the noble thing and programming in C just won't cut it. The first program will take 40+ hours in C, or 10 hours in Java. Your choice. You have plenty of time for the programs. The separate theory homeworks are assigned with only 1 week to do them (sometimes concurrently with the programs), so if you don't start early they can be tough.\r\n\r\nHis tests and theory problems work the same way. You learn the basic concepts in the class. Then you're asked questions that rearrange problems to something you've never seen before and are something that was covered in class. The only way you can do well is if you have a strong understanding of the material (obviously).\r\n\r\nHe is a fair/generous grader and a nice guy if you go to his office hours. Listen, ask questions in class, start the programs relatively early (and do them in Java!), know the concepts and you'll do fine. Usually the class has a low average too.\r\n\r\nDo take this course even if it's not required for your track.

I, too, was somewhat worried after reading the old reviews, but now that I've taken a course with him, I know for a fact that those are not an accurate description of him. (Maybe his evil twin brother as someone suggested...) If you need to/want to take Fundamentals, by all means, take it with him.\r\n\r\nHe makes great lecture slides(that are actually better than the textbooks) and post them on the courseworks ahead of time. Some students just read over the lecture notes and do not attend the lectures, but I suggest not to do it because 1. the lecture notes are quite condense and hard to understand without the aid of lectures (at least for me)  and 2. it's one of the few classes where lectures are golden. His lectures are very interactive and he makes it obvious that he's enthusiastic about teaching (which can only help the students). Although the pacing can be somewhat fast at times, if a student asks a question, he'll slow down and explain to make sure the student understands the material. \r\n\r\nThere's about one homework per each week (9 HW total). Homeworks are reasonable, but can be tough. It depends on how much background knowledge you have (If you're good at circuits, you'll breeze through the first half of the course). Start at least 3 days before it's due and go to the office hr if you're having a hard time. His tests are open book/open note, but since he asks design questions, you have to have a solid understanding of the material. There's no surprise questions and he won't try to trick you, but will test you how much you understand the core of the material. Take HW problems seriously, as they will help you tremendously. \r\n\r\nOffice hrs literally saved me. This is the only course I attended office hrs on the regular basis. You come in with a question, and you will walk out with a full understanding of the material. If you have a schedule conflict with regular office hr, don't hesitate to email him and make an appointment. He truly cares about his students, and he'll make time for you. In fact, I never went to his regular office hr as I had another class during the time, but I never had a problem getting help whenever I needed. I got the questions that would take me 10 hrs to understand answered in 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nHe's approachable, funny, enthusiastic, and truly cares about the students. \r\nTake this course with him if you can, and you won't regret it.

The best days in class were when Edwards/Kim came in to sub for Prof Rubenstein when he was out.\r\n\r\nThe worst offenses:\r\n* He is not prepared enough for the lectures in order to make the material engaging or easy to understand. They consist of him reading off of his overly complicated slides and often not coming up for air.\r\n* He does not require a textbook but suggests two textbooks. His slides are basically reproductions of the books. I had the textbooks and did not think that the slides were enough to understand the material by. I think it's unfortunate that he uses two books when the course could be summed up in one book. He should drop the awful Mano and Kime book.\r\n* His homeworks are a mixture of totally tedious repetitive nonsense (adding binary numbers excessively) which teach little, to extremely esoteric circuit creations which also do little to explore your understanding of the material. Perhaps the course is meant to test your ability in solving puzzles through building circuits - if that is the goal then I guess I've misunderstood the intention of this course.\r\n* His homework policy is to allow for cheating. He allows people to collaborate on the assignments which in my opinion discourages anyone from doing their own work. For those that do their own work and do not compare answers before submission are just out of luck I guess. If you submit without comparing your answers and knowing you have 100% going in, I guess your'e a dope. If the whole class is allowed to collaborate why even give credit for the assignment?\r\n* His exams are insanely unfair in my opinion. After having done reasonably well on the homework assignments I felt unprepared for the midterm/final. There are some reasonable questions but then there are those that will boggle the mind how they accurately test my understanding and knowledge of the material. But again maybe I've failed to understand the goal of this course. His exams consisted of reading a mountain of text to explain the premise of creating some new fangled circuitry. Then having questions part b through d rely on your successful understanding and completion of part a. It doesn't help that in this mountain of text it is mostly incoherent explanation of what he is trying to express. My impression is that they were overly complicated and/or error filled.\r\n* I have had some minor experience with this course's topic before and usually find it fascinating but I found myself unwilling to participate towards the end.\r\n* The course covers too much ground and not enough of it carefully. There seems to be a theme that a lot of what we are learning is not necessary to know. That's insane to me. Everything we learn should be at least interesting and inform our future. Cut out the small extraneous that have no relevance.\r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n* He is a nice guy and office hours are very useful.\r\n* When he would work out a problem manually on the board this was a very useful exercise. Often I think he would realize the absurdity of certain questions when it would take him 20-30 minutes to complete.\r\n* He reads feedback and there was an adjustment to the pace of the class which at first was going a mile a minute for no reason.",

In any case take, everything with a grain of salt. \r\n\r\nNow there are a factors here that contributed to this that are beyond Rubenstein's control and are my fault, such as the fact that I don't really have a background in computer science, I never went to his office hours (I did attend the TA's occasionally), and I'm a second semester senior.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Rubenstein's style is that of the prototypical SEAS professor. There's a certain level of irony to this, because in his lectures he comes across as personable guy, he speaks English quite well, and he has a great sense of humor, none of which are very typical for engineering professors I suppose. However, none of that means shit if you spend all your lectures expressionlessly reading off slides, do not provide a good text book and assign cryptic error-riddled homeworks expecting people to be able to solve them purely based on what you wrote on those self-same slides. These slides, as the previous reviewer pointed out are also often riddled with errors. Moreover, they are quite repetitive and there are only a few that are truly important in every lecture, whereas the rest seemed like useless filler. Then there are topics that show up that aren't covered very well in the slides on both homeworks and tests. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, I'm pretty sick of this en vogue teaching style where professors don't have to do anything except for recite from slides. It's not conducive to learning, and yet somehow the super-genius professors of SEAS still haven't figured out why people don't attend their classes. Or more likely they have, they just don't give a shit, since giving a shit about their students is not high on their priority list. This obviously wasn't the first class where this has happened, and I sincerely doubt it will be the last. The true tragedy here is that Rubenstein seemed well enough aware, occasionally stopping in the middle of his lectures to ask the class if they understood what he just said, and when less than half the class raised their hand, he would proceed to explain the exact same concept all over again in the exact same way.  This created the illusion of concern, while truly accomplishing nothing at all. \r\n\r\nAgain, it may be harsh or nigh impossible for me to claim he didn't care when I never went to his office hours; however, generally speaking, his lecturing style came off as lazy and unconcerned, which puts him squarely in the \"average\" range for SEAS professors. As far as attending office hours goes, he said that if we could show him we knew what we were talking about in office hours it could only help our grade. Unfortunately his lectures were often so devoid of content, I actually didn't learn very much, so I truly didn't know what I was talking about and probably deserved the C. \r\n\r\nSo I guess you should take him if you want a lecturer with an interesting personality and sense of humor and have a pretty good background in this stuff.

That happened because I attended office hours each week for assistance on understanding and completing the homework. Contrary to others' claims, I learned more in the class by having the opportunity to effectively discuss the questions and solutions to the HW with great TA's and with the professor. If you showed up with relative knowledge of the material, the professor or TA's would literally give you the answer if you couldn't reach it yourself. They sought to totally set you up for success. If you didn't take advantage of that assistance, that is your fault and I don't feel bad for you. \r\n\r\nThe criticism I have for this class amounts to concerns about interest by the professor. I don't believe Professor Rubenstein is teaching material he prefers to teach or learn. This results in a class that is less enjoyable, and is unfortunate at Columbia. His course would be 10X better if he enjoyed what he taught, and showed that. That being said, he showed he cares for his students' performance and puts in his stated time to assisting students. \r\n\r\nI wish I had purchased the book. I think the summaries he provided were at times challenging to understand. I also wish the course had a bit more of a clear connection and purpose between the first half of the semester and second, but we always have concerns. \r\n\r\nThe perspective is this - We can read, understand, draw, and design circuits that do cool shit. And if you can't, you screwed up in class and I don't feel bad for you. And you also probably cheated off someone else's homework so fuck you.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "review_text": "Rubenstein's a pretty chill guy, but not the best professor. He often gets confused by his own typo-riddled slides. You would expect a professor who has taught this class several times in the past to know his material by now and have error-free slides. While some of these mistakes were corrected, there are still plenty of typos in his lecture slides, so be aware of that when studying from them. Also, logistics are poorly organized with HWs being posted late and taking forever to be graded.\r\n\r\nStarting with basic logic gates, the course slowly builds up towards creating a CPU. You learn about the underlying hardware behind a simple computer and how the programs you write actually work. The material in the first half of the class can be a bit boring, but you see how everything comes together when discussing the MIPS architecture, which is pretty cool. I was bored because of the slow start (I took Intro to EE and CS Theory before Fundamentals, so the first month was just a rehash of things I already knew). Hence, I never participated or really cared about was going on. Rubenstein would also give students points for discovering errors in his slides, and I felt like it detracted from the class because it \"gamifies\" education. Sometimes I would notice mistakes in the slides and not bring them to his attention because I didn't want to partake in his silly point system. Also, the homeworks were super tedious and didn't teach you much. They aren't representative of the harder yet more thought-provoking questions he asks on his exams.\r\n\r\nThe midterm was hard. It was longer than the practice tests, and it was nearly impossible to finish within the allotted time. It also had a couple of typos. His exams are open book, but it doesn't really help much because the questions he asks on exams generally require you to extend circuitry covered in class and solve problems creatively. He has good intentions for his exams. They are designed to make students think by asking non-trivial and interesting problems, but they're poorly executed because of the often long and winding questions or just because Prof. Rubenstein didn't think the solution through enough leading to a different answer than what he expected. Partly because of my attitude towards class and because of the difficulty of the test, I did pretty badly on the midterm.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the class, I made an active effort to pay attention. I found the course much more enjoyable (may have been because the material became more interesting) and Prof. Rubenstein a much better teacher. He's pretty helpful in Office Hours, so please go to them if you get stuck. The final was better than the midterm because I actually cared about the material and also because of the extra time we had. In the end, what you get out of this class depends on how much effort you put into it. Rubenstein's not the most inspiring teacher, so unless you take the effort to ask him good questions, classes can be pretty boring. You have to push him to take an interest in teaching you.\r\n\r\nI think, overall, it might be better to take Fundamentals with Martha Kim for now. Rubenstein's not bad, but there's a lot he can do to improve Fundamentals. (He also reads CULPA reviews, so I hope he makes the class better in the future).",

      "review_text": "Ah, Rubenstein. He spent the first lecture telling us how last year's culpa reviews were all wrong, and at first I thought it was going to be okay but then...\r\n\r\nOkay, okay. So he's not the worst. It could always be worse. I survived the class and learned some cool stuff. And yeah, he's a nice guy and a great person. But when every sample final exam that he gives us has at least one mistake in it, and when he doesn't even know the answers to his own homework problems... It makes me pretty worried.\r\n\r\nI actually don't think that he was that bad of a lecturer and I didn't really mind that the slides had some typos (though I'd maybe recommend not scribbling all over the whole slide in red... I heard someone got him a stylus but I don't think that helped much). He was decently helpful during office hours too, and he does seem to really care about us learning.\r\n\r\nThe main problems were the homeworks and exams. As a previous reveiwer mentioned, homeworks were posted late and graded late and sometimes tedious, but that wasn't even the worst part. Towards the end, some of his homeworks would ask questions to which he didn't even realise the answer, until a student pointed something out to him in office hours. He then tried to say that it was still an answer too but, c'mon, when the question asks \"How can you minimize stalling?\", \"you actually can't\" shouldn't be the answer.\r\n\r\nOur own midterm had a few very significant typos in it (he gave an example of how his state machine worked and his example contradicted the instructions) and our final had a few errors too. Luckily, he grades on a pretty good curve. I didn't think I was doing amazing but I ended up with an A.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you're stuck taking this class with Rubenstein, it's okay, just keep up with the material, go to office hours if you need to, and find some friends in the class to cry with when you can't handle it. And hope that he's a bit more organized next year. If you have a choice though, I'd recommend trying Kim.",

      "review_text": "Discrete Mathematics, as taught by Professor Grinspun, is a CS prerequisite I am very happy to be taking.  Professor Grinspun's computer graphics research is really cool, but that is outside the scope of this review.  The main strength of COMS W3203 is clarity.  Professor Grinspun's lectures are so understandable that I have not usually needed to read the textbook in depth.  If anything, they are too basic and move too slowly, although there is plenty of time to ruminate on the materials in class.  The textbook (by Kenneth Rosen) is also excellent, being both engaging and informative.  The difficulty and pacing of the course changed relatively little as the semester progressed, a teaching accomplishment in itself.    \r\n\r\nThe curriculum focuses roughly equally on proof-writing and problem-solving--a fair division, although I wish there had been more discussion of how Discrete Math can be applied.\r\n\r\nThe homework was where most of my learning took place, and it would have been a mistake not to do it as thoroughly as possible even if each assignment is only 4 percent of the grade.  (Not everyone does their homework thoroughly.)  Homework is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for preparing for the three exams, which are long and complicated exercises in problem-solving and proof-writing speed.  As a warning, almost no one could finish the second midterm exam.  This includes some of the best remaining students.  Fortunately, the exams' open-book nature and the grading curve meant they were actually easier than exams in many other classes.  The 6 homework assignments were 9 to 20 handwritten pages each, and each one usually took me 10-20 hours to finish.  Many questions were difficult, and office hours often saved me.  \r\n\r\nThis course has a high attrition rate--perhaps one-third to more than half of the original students choose to drop it after the first lecture, including some of Columbia's best and brightest.  There might be several reasons for this.  Professor Grinspun calls on students unannounced and does not hesitate to embarrass them (although I never saw him embarrassing anyone unprovoked).  Homework 1 was as difficult as the other assignments, which may have led some students to believe the course would be more demanding than it actually was.  The heavily proof-oriented nature of Discrete Math may also have scared off some.  In my opinion, DROPPING THIS COURSE INSTEAD OF PRESSING THROUGH IS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.  My experience was that around week 4 of the course, proofs suddenly became less intimidating and around week 5 or 6, Professor Grinspun mellowed out.  What students contend with is a not especially time-consuming commitment, as CS courses go, and possibly one of the 5 best undergraduate courses in the CS department.  I enjoy it, and would strongly recommend it to students with the appropriate background (some introduction to programming such as COMS W1004; pre-calculus or, better yet, calculus; and, if you're really concerned about writing proofs, the supposedly well-taught Introduction to Higher Mathematics).",

Take this class late in your CS career - the more programming experience you have, the better.\r\n\r\nHomeworks are difficult, but you are provided with a code base that provides visual debugging tools, as well as a grading script with numerous tests that gives you an accurate idea of the performance (and final grade) of your code. All homeworks come with a PDF explaining the physics concepts behind the code for that week, and although there were some errors, the PDFs were for the most part very helpful, especially if you happened to miss a lecture. (In the case of mistakes in the PDF, extensions were often given)\r\n\r\nTo prepare: learn linear algebra, refresh your knowledge of differential calculus (mandatory), be a strong C++ programmer, and, although it is not listed in the course requirements, I STRONGLY recommend some kind of physics background. While Grinspun does go over this material in class, if you start with at least one college-level physics class under your belt, the lectures and homeworks will be much more comprehensible, and you won't waste time learning elementary physics.\r\n\r\nGrading: I include this section to discuss some grading policies I disagreed with. 85% of the homework grade comes from the \"bot\", or the test suite mentioned earlier. The other 15% comes from a mandatory creative scene, built by you to showcase the elements developed for that weeks milestone. At the beginning of the class, Grinspun said you do not need artistic skill to succeed in this class. However, I disagree. If your code works 100% according to the script, you could still get a B on the assignment if you fail to produce a good creative. These creatives are then judged by your peers, who determine the remaining 15% of your grade. Humorous creatives can outweigh visually pleasing creatives, so if you're in a time crunch, go for that. The professors and the TA's weigh in on these grades, so they may give you more points if they see technical ability not easily recognized by your peers.\r\nExtra credit is awarded for the top 5 creative scenes, and sporadic extra credit is offered throughout the semester on the homeworks (when it is offered, it is a lot! Do it!)\r\n\r\nExams: None. There is a final project worth the weight of two \"milestones\"/homeworks, which is left up to you. You could modify the code base to produce an extravagant creative, implement a technical paper, or implement algorithms from the class in an external software - whatever you want.\r\n\r\nBottom line: If you have any interest in computer graphics or animation, take this class. It will either weed you out, or light a fire under you to go farther in the field. It's a love-it or hate-it class, since you will have to really commit, but if you want to be in this field, you cant miss this opportunity.", 
      "workload_text": "Heavy. Weekly homework assignments, containing a program and a creative. The programming assignments tended to take me 4-5 days, and the mandatory creative scenes took up the rest of the time until the deadline. Obviously, the more time you spend on the creative scene, the better your assignment grade, so this system favors students who can complete the assignments faster. It is not easy to get an A in this class, but it is possible. Grinspun only gives A+ grades to exceptional students who he believes have gone above and beyond."

      "review_text": "CS Theory as taught by Yannakakis is a good class -- it achieves everything you basically expect a class to, though it isn't outstanding in any particular regard. \r\n\r\nFor almost the entire semester Yannakakis follows the textbook (\"Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation\"), and it pays to read the text ahead of time. The book is light on theory and heavy on examples, and you could probably get away with not going to class for the first 10 weeks or so until Turing Machine reductions start to be explained, because the book's explanations until then are always thorough enough. Lecture clarifies and sometimes expands a bit on the book, but not in any fundamental way, e.g. there might be a slower and a faster way to implement a given algorithm, and the book gives the slower one while Yannakakis will show the faster one in class. Once you get into Turing Machines, going to lecture is pretty important. The book sucks on reductions.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer Yannakakis isn't exciting (it didn't help that this semester's room was poorly lit and had amphitheater style seating -- quite conducive to dozing off) but he is usually quite effective at going through examples clearly. He's been doing this for long enough to know which points people get confused about, and he makes sure to hammer those home. The only times I was truly lost in class were on a handful of particularly weird proofs that he demonstrated purely to make a point; they never came up on homework or exams.\r\n\r\nYannakakis is (as those of you who've Googled him will know), a pretty big name in the field with a prize or two to his name. There aren't many opportunities in CS Theory for him to show off his brilliance, but he is clearly in total command of the material in a way that not all professors always are. He virtually never makes mistakes on the blackboard (he's usually working from his lecture slides, which are excellent and available on CourseWorks), and will occasionally respond to a seemingly narrow question by tying it to much broader questions and answering those, too.", 
      "workload_text": "1 midterm, 1 final, 30% each. 6 homeworks, 40%, partly written, partly through an online service called Gradiance. The grading was usually pretty fair. One TA graded all problem 1's, a different one graded all problem 2's, etc.\r\n\r\nThe midterm and final are both pretty manageable if you go over the lecture slides and homework. No proofs, though there are occasionally slightly sneaky questions. Just know your conversion algorithms (e.g. regular expression to epsilon NFA) and their runtimes, as well as your language closure properties (and constructions for those properties) and you'll be about 90% ready.\r\n\r\nThe homework is 2-3 hours work each if you do the reading first, and Gradiance is perhaps half an hour. Gradiance allows unlimited retakes, which is pretty neat, though you have to wait 10 minutes between attempts. If you have a lot of time to burn, you can just retake Gradiance often enough to solve all the questions by process of elimination (there's a fairly small pool of answers, so after about 90 minutes you've seen them all)."

      "review_text": "This was an OK class. CS Theory with Yannakakis is neither good nor bad. The subject itself is very interesting. It's just the presentation of the material by Yannakakis and the textbook (HMU) that is lacking.\r\n\r\nYannakakis is no doubt a brilliant man, but he's a mediocre teacher. He puts up slides of lecture notes on Courseworks and teaches directly off of them in class. This led to maybe 30 out of 87 students actually attending the class.\r\n\r\nThe textbook often has convoluted proofs and too few examples. It's the defacto textbook for automate theory, but I think it could be improved. Sipser is another book which has slightly better explanations.\r\n\r\nYannakakis teaches concepts in a reasonable manner given the dense material. Most people didn't attend class and just studied from the slides and textbook. His explanations are not much better than the textbook and you can learn everything from his slides.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to make sure you are up to speed with what's being covered in class. The material can be dense and hard to follow, so try not to get lost because it will lead to a disaster when exams come around.\r\n\r\nProblem sets (40% of grade) generally have 1 or 2 easy questions and the rest are hard. It is advisable to check your work with classmates since homework counts for 40% of your grade and you shouldn't lose too many points on it.\r\n\r\nDon't worry too much if you don't completely understand some complicated proofs (eg- NFA to Regex, PDA to CFG conversions). If you know the method that it proves, you'll be fine for exams. He never asked to prove something in an exam. Questions were along the lines of design a DFA, CFG, Turing machine, algorithm, do a reduction, etc. Some of them can be tricky.\r\n\r\nThe midterm (30%) and final (30%) consisted of 6 and 5 questions respectively and were both in class. They were manageable, but kind of hard since we got so little practice solving problems. The course is mostly theory with few examples and 4 problems per homework don't really prepare you for the tests. Make sure to study all the lecture slides and problem sets for exams. Read the textbook whenever you get confused by the lecture slides.\r\n\r\nGrading is fair. TAs grade both problem sets and exams. Final letter grades were also very reasonable.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't avoid Yannakakis, but neither would I recommend taking this class if someone better (like Aho or Malkin) were teaching it the next semester.",

He also handled questions from the class very well, and it was clear that no question ever came close to phasing him.  His progression through the material was both organized and logical.  If I had any criticism, it would be that we went rather slowly through details of proofs and constructions that didn\u2019t seem very fundamental to the course, and we could\u2019ve gone through a bit more material if some of this was streamlined.  \r\n\r\nThe assignments for the course were very reasonable in scope and they did a good job enforcing the important points for each topic.  It seemed that he actually chose the problems based on what he covered in lecture and thought was important.  They were assigned and due every 2 weeks, and each consisted of four problems of varying difficulty.  Solutions to these were posted after they were handed in, and graded problem sets were returned a week after completion.\r\n\r\nThe exam were also pretty fair.

The material is very well-motivated and he involves the class in his lectures by frequently asking questions.  He is able to thoroughly answer any question that comes up from the class.  There are few to no errors in the lectures, and detailed lecture notes are posted on Courseworks.  The textbook is the bible for the subject and it is well-written, but he doesn\u2019t strictly follow it, so it\u2019s really not necessary for the course.  \r\n\r\nThe homework assignments were also very well-written and unambiguous, and ultimately at the heart of the course.  I definitely learned a lot from working through them.  While this class is the natural follow-up to CS theory, one difference is that there are fewer formulaic problems that simply require following an algorithm.  Usually a bit of thought is required for most of the homework problems, but they\u2019re manageable as long as you don\u2019t leave them until the last minute.

There's no single textbook and the readings, while usually interesting, vary greatly in terms of how thoroughly they cover their subjects.  On top of that, while lecture notes are posted online, they usually provide only a broad outline of what Bellovin says in class, so it can be hard to find reference material for homeworks or for studying if you missed a class or didn't take good notes.\n\nAlso, Bellovin appears to be something of a big shot in the computer security world outside of academia (eg., helped write Usenet back in the day, won the 2007 NIST / NASA security award).  This is kind of cool, but involves him missing a relatively large number of classes to travel to conferences and so on.

His board posts are essential (and appreciated) given the difficulty of his assignments.\r\n\r\nThe 6 assignments can be quite time-intensive for people who are less than overqualified, including top students from the recommended prerequisite course (COMS W1004).  A substantial number of students have a much stronger background than this, and some have practically taken COMS W1007 beforehand.  These may be the people who would call the workload \"not too bad.\"  The rest of us just get a lot of programming practice.  Fortunately, the grading and grading curve are generous.  The median grade is usually B+, and this semester it might be A-.  \r\n\r\nLectures are understandable and thorough.  Professor Blaer sometimes talks so quickly that note taking becomes a bit difficult, but most of the material is from the textbook anyway.  The textbook, _Object-Oriented Design and Patterns_ by Cay Horstmann, explains concepts reasonably clearly but provides inexcusably buggy solutions to exercises.  Exams are long and information-intensive, but manageable if you've studied.\r\n\r\nProfessor Blaer LOVES to make fun of students who procrastinate (he never singles out individual people but talks about Columbia students as a group).  He is also merciful toward those who do procrastinate, because of his liberal extension policy.  Sometimes he says things about the average student's level of organization (i.e. our lack thereof) that aren't true.  I hope his lectures get put on CVN because they are so good, but those parts are cut because they reflect badly on Columbia University and are a lie.  Most students are doing well this semester, and our organizational skills are one of the reasons. \r\n\r\nI highly recommend this course, but only if a student has taken COMS W1004 or the equivalent beforehand.  Otherwise they might get buried in coursework.",

Blaer is a really engaging lecturer and an all-around smart, friendly guy -- he was happy to entertain various questions I had about side projects totally unrelated to the course material, and is really accessible outside of class.\r\n\r\nThe homework turns out to be enjoyable as well -- there's enough freedom and flexibility in the assignments, particularly the middle few, that you can have fun playing around within the constraints.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I highly recommend Blaer (and would happily take any other course he teaches), but be wary of signing up for 1007 if you come from a CS background.",

Homeworks took me roughly 10-15 hours to complete (boy did I hate the computer labs in Hartley and Mudd after this course), granted I usually did them the weekend before they were due, but it was painful. \r\n\r\nProfessor Blaer moves very quickly in his lectures, flipping back and forth between Editor and Workspace so it was often difficult to write down what he had typed before he switched windows. He would also go back into code and edit what he had originally to create a new example, easy to do on a computer but almost impossible to write down the whole code again with the change (usually very small but really important to his point) by hand before he switched back to the workspace. \r\n \r\nI went to every lecture but got lost during histograms and plotting and never really recovered until the last homework. I still don't understand the whole image-histograms-plotting thing, which bodes well for the final tomorrow. An unfortunate fact about matlab; not many people take it unless they are comp sci majors or bme kids (or need to fill the comp sci requirement for seas like me), so help around campus is limited. \r\n\r\nMy advice? If you've never taken comp sci before then find yourself a study/homework buddy in either your class or as an upperclassmen who has taken matlab before. Go to lecture. Get used to the idea of spending hours at a time in the computer lab (bring a sweatshirt, it gets cold in mudd). If you get to a point in the homework where you just can't handle it anymore, it's ok to just turn it in (especially if it's past 3am).

Overall, a terrible experience that I'm glad I'm over with. \r\n\r\nProf. Blaer, in his lecturing ability, isn't to blame for why I hated this class so much. He's very clear in explaining the material and a funny guy overall. He was able to keep me awake even after I pulled an all-nighter working on the first assignment (see below).\r\n\r\nThe material is too sparse to deserve an entire semester. For anyone who has taken AP Computer Science AB (not me, and for future CULPA readers, I guess not you, either), the actual data structures covered would already be second-nature, and the associated algorithms would be simple. I stopped going to lectures really early on in the semester since each week covered only roughly five pages of the textbook. \r\n\r\nThe homeworks were absolutely ridiculous. Most of the programming in the homework assignments didn't involve implementing the data structures (instead, we were just allowed to steal the source code from the textbook's website), but instead revolved around Java GUIs. All but one of the assignments had uninteresting programs for us to code (unsurprisingly, that exception was the one that involved the least fiddling around with GUIs) and in general took quite awhile of experimentation. Furthermore, the TAs were incredibly slow at grading the assignments. The 60-odd people's assignments were divided among four TAs (the remaining TA was solely recitation instructor) but would take somewhere between 3-4 weeks to get back to you. Of course, you could just say, \"oh, each assignment takes a long time to grade,\" but the fact that they managed to grade all the exams within six hours after the midterm demonstrates that they can grade quickly, but simply choose not to. \r\n\r\nOn the bright side, code didn't have to be as strictly formatted and documented as it did in 1007... and...

      "review_text": "Paul Blaer is one of the best professors I've had at Columbia. His ability to clearly present course material and actually make you learn something is unparalleled. His lectures are very straightforward and well-paced. He will essentially analyze and go through each data structure/algorithm step-by-step, making sure the class is with him as he goes along. He's also a pretty funny guy and will sometimes go on tangents, but they were always CS-related and will be interesting and beneficial to you if you are a CS major (i.e., go to lecture! You don't know what you'll miss). He is a very accessible guy and friendly one-on-one, so although he's intimidating at first, don't be afraid to go to office hours or ask questions in class. A misguided reviewer for this course will have you believe that taking AP Computer Science AB will make this course a breeze. This is NOT the case. I have taken the AB course and I still learned a wealth of information from Blaer, not to mention that most of the material after the midterm was not covered in AB, including perhaps the most important topic, graph theory.\r\n\r\nEach homework assignment is divided into two parts: theory and programming. People I know in this class complained about the GUI. Yes, there is a lot of GUI, so be prepared--in fact, I'd say the GUI is about 50% of each programming assignment, which isn't necessarily a good thing, but it probably builds character or something. However, they tend to be fairly simple, such as drawing dots on a grid or drawing binary trees (protip: if you abstract your first tree GUI interface well enough, you can reuse it later on for at least one more assignment). However, there is just as much theory as there is GUI, and the theory is much more challenging than simply looking up how a JComponent works. Most theory questions are taken from the book and definitely require a bit of thought before you arrive at a solution. \r\n\r\nOverall, if you have the option of taking this course with Blaer, don't wait. Take it with him. You'll learn data structures, you'll learn algorithms, you'll probably write some painful GUI code that you don't want to, but you'll come away a better computer science student.

      "review_text": "I honestly wanted to like this class, and expected to after reading several positive reviews.  Maybe there is an inherent flaw in teaching a class like this during the summer, but I suspect that the fatal flaw of this class was that it wasn't well planned.  Nonetheless, as I read the other reviews of Professor Blaer, I am suspecting that he might be better at implementing a course during the fall or spring than during the summer.  \r\n\r\nIt seemed that this entire class was planned as an afterthought, and the class seemed to operate under principles that I previously thought violated those of learning computer science.  I thought computer science was about thoroughly understanding concepts and creatively applying them to solving problems.  I also thought that lectures were a supplementary feature to the learning process, and that the most important part of the learning came when working through assignments.  Finally, I was under the impression that computer science is a subject one couldn't cram for, and the way to learn is through practice.  I'm hoping that I was right about all this, and that the only reason I am questioning it now is due to the faulty implementation of this course.\r\n\r\nI went into this class with the expectation exams should be doable if one is able to figure out the homework assignments on your own.  After all, the purpose of said exams are to ensure that people truly understand the material and don't get rewarded with a top grade for getting through the assignments without fully understanding them (for example, by getting excessive TA help or copying from other students).  However, that really wasn't the case in this course.  The exams tested concepts and syntax that were not covered in the assignments, or that were covered in assignments that weren't assigned until after the exam.  (For example, the first time we were ever asked to write a program using anonymous classes was during the midterm exam.  These is nothing inherently difficult about using anonymous classes in Java, as it is just a quirky syntax to get used to.  However, this straightforward exam problem was significantly more challenging due to the fact that we had never been asked to implement an anonymous class on the computer prior to the exam.)  To be fair, he did teach the concepts in lecture, but it is very difficult (for most people) to learn computer science enough to quickly apply it exclusively through lectures.  \r\n\r\nAnother expectation I had in taking a computer science class over the summer was that I'd be drinking from the fire hose.  I thought I'd be working hard and losing sleep to finish assignments on time.  The only time I truly found myself working hard and losing sleep to get the task done in the time allotted was when cramming for exams.  \r\n\r\nThere were only four homework assignments, each of which consisted of a written portion and a programming portion.  The content of these assignments was fair.  They were time consuming (except for the first one), but completely reasonable in scope.  Nothing we were required to do went beyond the concepts discussed in class, yet I still found myself learning a good deal while working through these assignments.  That being said, I would've liked another assignment or two in order to thoroughly learn the material that was covered on exams but not on the projects, as well as to lessen the weight of each assignment on our grade.  Moreover, he extended the deadline for every assignment, which was great for the students who procrastinated.  However, for those of us who started the assignments when they were released, these extensions were more of a punishment because they were often granted after we had already allocated significant time to completing the assignment prior to the original deadline.  Further, he did not make the new assignment available until the extended due date of the previous one (despite promising to make them available earlier on a few occasions).  Due to the poor timing of assignments, the final assignments ended up being due the midnight prior to the final exam.  \r\n\r\nFeedback was another story.  Initially there was a single grader for the class, and as a result we did not receive feedback on the first homework assignment until the middle of the fourth week of class.  At that point, a new grader was hired.  The class ended last night and we have currently received feedback on two of our four homework assignments.  It also took two weeks to hand back the midterm exam in class.  To be fair, the instructor admitted that the lack of TA help was a problem the course was facing.  However, these delays were more than just annoying: they caused many students to be penalized multiple times for the same mistake.\r\n\r\nLectures largely consisted of presentation of the textbook author's slides, from the book \"Object-Oriented Design and Patterns\" by Cay Horstmann, and occasionally he'd present additional examples of his own.  These lectures were fine, but not exactly easy to pay attention to for three hours.  Easy or not, paying attention was important, as many points he made during lecture had a tendency to show up on exams despite not appearing in the assignments nor being emphasized in the textbook.  When the instructor presented his own code, there was often a several day delay between the presentation of the code and the uploading of this code to the course website, which made at least one of the assignments much more difficult than it needed to be.  \r\n\r\nIf you are planning to take this offering in the future, make sure you are very confident in your ability to learn computer science quickly and without much practice.  Otherwise, you will probably be sensitive to the problems with the course.\r\n\r\n",

However, given the finite probability that computer science continues to show the lack of judgment that they showed in allowing him to teach COMS 1007 this past summer, I feel justified in writing this review.\r\n\r\nI just got reminded this morning that I took COMS 1007 with Professor Blaer this past summer when I got an email that my grade arrived.  The date of the final exam was Thursday August 9th.  I had been checking Courseworks weekly since the end of the course, and this is the first time that I saw the grades posted for assignments 3-4.  I am currently enrolled in COMS 3137 and have completed the first two assignments prior to receiving my grades for the last two assignments and my final grade from COMS 1007.  There is still no grade posted on Courseworks for the final exam, and given that combined with the discrepancy between how well I did in the course and how poorly I felt I did on the final, I'm wondering if he even graded and/or counted the final exam.  This might sound like an outlandish accusation, but the classmates who I've talked to are  all speculating the same idea.  \r\n\r\nProfessor Blaer told us during the final lecture, on Tuesday August 7th, that he was setting the following Monday as the grading deadline for the TAs, and therefore that we should expect to know our final grades by the Tuesday of that week.  We were never contacted with notification of any delay.  At first I thought it was just me when my grade wasn't posted all summer, but then I got to COMS 3137 and found that several of my classmates who were in the summer class had not received their grades either, and we all had contacted him several times via email, telephone, and direct office visits.  Professor Blaer didn't respond to most of the emails or telephone calls, and he wasn't in his office when most people arrived.  However, whenever one of us did hear from him, he said that the grades would be up \"by the end of the day.\"  \r\n\r\nThe lack of feedback and organization in this class was representative of the fact that the concern for students' learning was absent, which is a shame.  After all, isn't that the point of any class?  Professor Blaer's lectures were fine.  They weren't amazing, but they were fine.  However, in teaching a class in computer science, organization and feedback are at least as important as the lectures.  I'm my personal opinion, they're far more important because most of the true learning comes from working through and receiving feedback on assignments. ",

      "review_text": "I took this class having little prior programming experience, having only learned a bit of MATLAB in Art of Engineering. For SEAS and particularly BME students who are required to take this class, having the background in MATLAB from AoE is pretty useful and allows you to slide through the first couple of weeks easily. However, as the class progresses you start discussing Big O notation, structs, object oriented programming, functions like varargin and varargout, and recursion, which were not mentioned in AoE but are really useful to know and require some more time. Later in the course when Blaer talks about histogramming images, you can again use some of the code you wrote in AoE in the homework for this class. Anyway, Blaer is a great professor. He's easily approachable immediately after class or in his office hours. Blaer holds review sessions before the midterm and final, which are really helpful. He tells you what he's going to test over, explains challenging concepts, and in some cases tells you the exact questions. The best advice I can give is to go to class, because Blaer's teaching really clarifies the concepts asked about in the homework.

Also he uploads the things he ran in Matlab at the end of lecture so you see what you kinda covered during the lecture. Definitely go to class. \r\n\r\nNo textbook required: i managed without it. You can also find a lot of the things on the Matlab website. \r\n\r\nWorkload: He has 6 problem sets and drops one. You should not wait until the day before its due because some will take a bit of time. Start early and do a little each day and workload isn't bad at all. Also, he often extends the due date for things which is always a plus for you procrastinators but don't try to rely on that. \r\n\r\nExams: He reviews what will be on it and reviews the exam after. \r\n\r\nExams go for \"breadth rather than depth.\" Exams weren't too difficult at all. You shouldn't have an awful time. He's also quite friendly and approachable. I found he answers emails in an appropriate amount of time. \r\n\r\nOverall I recommend this professor! ",

I honestly don't understand why some people chose not to attend this class because I found the book to be average at explaining concepts, while I found Professor Blaer to be exceptional at explaining the material. I rarely referred to the book after his lectures because I either understood the material from his lecture, or was able to understand is after digesting my notes. I think this is a sign of a great teacher. \r\n\r\nEven in a 200+ person class, Blaer was able to captivate the room with his large voice and abundant personality. In addition, he managed to encourage student participation, which kept the class interactive and engaging. In addition, occasionally, Professor Blaer would drive home the importance of a particular concept with a story about his research, which usually involved a hilarious and catastrophic ending involving multi-ton robots ramming into buildings or almost running people over. \r\n\r\nProfessor Blaer's exams are fairly straightforward and he essentially tells you about 50% of the exam, so these are fairly low stress endeavors. I found the final harder than the midterm, but still fairly straightforward. Not much to worry about here. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint with Professor Blaer is an organizational complaint. He would usually claim he would post the HW by a certain date and note post it till 3 or 4 days afterwards. He also granted classwide extensions in unecesarry situations which made the last HW assigned and due during reading week, which was poor planning on his part. Lastly, I feel that the first 15 minutes of class, where students as clarification questions on the HW, is a waste of time. If he wrote his questions in a less ambiguous manner, and used this class time to teach more material, that would be more efficient. Apart from those organization things, I can't complain about this professor. I would recommend his class to anyone in a heartbeat. ",

I started from knowing the functions I would need for the labs to Googling everything. Thankfully there's stackoverflow and cplusplus. He would also always extend the lab due dates to reasonable dates for everyone.\r\n\r\nTests were fair. He emphasizes that doing the labs on your own and understanding what's really going on will be the best preparation for the exams, and he means it. I didn't need to study much else beyond reviewing the lab solutions.\r\n\r\nJae also set up a course listserv in which he (Jae), the TAs, and the students could all participate. Anyone could ask or answer question, post articles related to computer science in general, etc. It's a good system, but you have to find a way to sort course e-mails from the rest of your inbox; the listserv totaled 766 e-mails throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nOverall, someone with any initiative and the ability to adapt to CS languages shouldn't have a problem with this course, and there's plenty of resources to help you along the way if you seek them out.

Median grade for almost all labs were perfect grade--so labs did not affect your grade that much if you're in the top 50%, the average grade for midterm was very high while the avg for final was around 60, which made the final exam the only differentiating factor of the grade for most of the students. Also, even though the final covered materials from about 6~7 labs, the test only focused on 2~3 labs and *everything* was one word answer with no description allowed--no coding, no partial credit, etc, which penalized students who \"almost got it\" very heavily.\r\n\r\nOne thing that made Jae's class great was its clean organization.

When I saw he was teaching again after he got his PhD, I was like YES, and now at the end, I'm just like meh. \r\n\r\nWell, the start was good. He set up a listserv to encourage class participation where students could ask questions and interact with TAs and other students. Everything was explained slowly for people who have never been exposed to C, but then he started to get behind on his lectures. That was sort of when things started going down hill. The labs were fun, but he would not have covered the material for them, and so he had to rush in class to cover what we needed to know on the labs, rather than take a good amount of time explaining things. Inevitably, he would have to YAX (yet another extension) them so he allowed people a reasonable amount of time to finish them. He also changed the labs from counting 40% of the course grade to 15%, which in my opinion has hurt a lot of people. We spend A LOT of time on doing the labs, which is why I think they should count more. That's where we do most of our learning, and where we can demonstrate we have an understanding of the material. \r\n\r\nThe midterm was really hard. After he gave us the midterm from fall 2011, which seemed very doable, the actual midterm was a disaster. The average was a 50 with a standard deviation of like 23. As someone who did well on the labs, I figured I was going to be fine on the midterm, but when I saw the midterm, I panicked because it seemed incomprehensible.

He does care for his students, but he's very curt and to the point when you talk with him in person.",

      "review_text": "I definitely wasn't alone in that I had a lot of mixed feelings about this class.  I'll start by saying that is certainly the only viable option for taking Advanced Programming.  (Sidenote: If you're even thinking about taking Shlomo Hershkop's course, you're better off dropping out of school than wasting your tuition on an insulting elaborate practical joke).  However, I wouldn't call this class an amazing one that you absolutely have to take before you graduate, unless of course it's a requirement.  It really is just a programming class.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I have no plans to take OS and I'm not sure when I'm going to use C again.  The general theme of this course was \"trust me - this will all be useful later.\"  As a result, the subject was as uninspiring as it gets, unless you happen to love learning about large amounts of syntax and technicalities of programing languages.  \r\n\r\nThe best part of the course was the labs (programming assignments).  They were very well written were never had ambiguities.  These assignments are the same every semester, and solutions are provided immediately after the deadline.  Though this technically makes it very easy to cheat, keep in mind that the labs are the core of this class, and there's no point in taking it if you're not interested in working through each of them.  Because they were so detailed, they could be a bit overwhelming to read the first time through, and it is very important to follow the instructions to the letter.  Ultimately, they were very enjoyable to work through, and I can honestly say I learned almost everything that I learned in this class from working through the assignments.  Rubrics were provided for each lab that clearly stated how points were awarded.  \r\n\r\nI personally didn't find the lectures that I attended all that helpful.  The ones at the chalkboard gave good introductions to topics, and I profited the most from these.  He'd often go over something too quickly, and then be asked to repeat it three or four times more.  Occasionally, he'd repeat a large portion of the previous lecture, though it was impossible to tell when he would do that.  Ultimately, it was clear that he made the effort, but had trouble keeping everyone in the large classroom on the same page.  There were a lot of times when he'd explain something simple, or say \"you remember this from last time, right?\" and then five minutes later someone would raise their hand and ask about it.  When he did hour-long demos from the computer with the lights out, I found it very difficult to focus.  I'd always try to follow along with him, inevitably miss one step and therefore be lost for the rest of the demo.  \r\n\r\nThe pacing was also strange, as the last three weeks were the only time we spent programming in C++.  Almost the entire first half of the semester was dedicated to the C language, and the remaining time was spent on systems programming in C.  I understand that the training in C might be important for people who plan to take OS, but for everyone else it seemed like overkill.  \r\n\r\nI really never got the point of the whole YAXing policy.  Looking back, the deadline for every lab besides the first one was extended, and roughly half were extended twice.  Sometimes, the announcement of the extension was within 24 hours of the original deadline.  Talking to previous students and looking at CULPA reviews, I see that he's been doing this same practice since he started teaching.  I can't help but wonder why.  It would make a lot more sense for him to just tell us how long we truly had for the assignment so that we could plan ahead.  At this point in teaching the class, he probably knows how long he actually plans to give the class for assignments. \r\n\r\nThe mailing list was something about which I seemed to have the minority opinion.  I was really not a fan of it.  It might've worked better with a smaller class, but for a class of 140 students it bordered on absurd.  There was so much showing off and subtle attempts to suck up to Jae.  Some attempts were not subtle at all; for example, when the final exam solutions were mailed out, one student sent out an email saying that the exam was very well designed, and that this was the best course he had ever taken.  People would also use the mailing list to tell the class about how they went further and did additional work.  \r\n\r\nThe worst part of this class, and by far the most frustrating, was the evaluation process.  Jae said on the first day that it is very difficult to write an exam that assess what we truly know.  After seeing last semester's exams, it is clear that he is making the exams substantially more difficult by the semester.    He always said that working independently through the labs was the best way to prepare.  As someone who did just that, I can frankly say I've never felt so unprepared for exams as I was in this class.  The issue wasn't my approach to the labs, nor was it that I wasn't studying hard enough.  The midterm was about the same length as the final even though the final was given during final exam period.  There were a total of 17 questions on the final, and every single one of them was either a (very) short answer or multiple choice, with absolutely no partial credit under any circumstances (and trust me, there were plenty of places to mess up).  Questions would be asked on code fragments that were as long as 3 pages.  Single short problems would often test 5 ideas at once and carried a high all-or-nothing point value.  To add insult to injury, there would be multiple questions testing the same trick.  It seemed crazy to me that single trick multiple choice questions carried the same amount of weight as entire programming assignments.  The only reason I didn't feel worse when walking out of an exam where I had to make a semi-educated guess on most questions was because I knew that no amount of preparation would've been sufficient.  \r\n\r\nUltimately, the final curve is very generous, with half of the class receiving at least an A-, and this will save you at the end of the semester if you work hard and have the right amount of luck.  The grades on both exams truly ranged from 0 (yes, zero) to 100, with the median on each around a 50.",

      "review_text": "I agree in general with the May 22 2013 reviewer on some of the basics (don't go anywhere near anything taught by Shlomo Hershkop, the exams are a bit of a crapshoot, details on labs can be a bit overwhelming but the detailed specs are ultimately a net positive) so go read that and then I'll focus on a few points where we differ to some degree/where things have changed:\r\n\r\n- This not \"just a programming class.\" Getting familiar with C means getting familiar with a lot of low-level system functionality. If you don't understand pointers and memory management completely intuitively, you'll never really understand what's going on in higher-level languages like Java. Jae Lee definitely gets you acquainted with pointers and memory management.\r\n\r\n- But you will learn a lot about real-world programming. For example: I hated the listserv early on and sent the professor a frustrated email about it, but I came around eventually. A lot of the big (and small) open source projects are built around listservs and all that comes with them. This class's listserv gets you used to the number and type of emails (including repetitiveness), the personalities that appear (the noob who asks a question he could've googled, the guy who replies to everything within 10 seconds but is kind of an asshole, the Benevolent Dictator For Life, i.e. Jae Lee, etc.), and so on.\r\n\r\n- YAXing (as many extensions as you want) is gone as of this semester. By all accounts, that's a big improvement. Also, we had two midterms this time around instead of just one.\r\n\r\n- I felt that the exams assessed the material quite fairly, although they generally played to my strengths and I did well on them without studying, so people who studied a lot and still did poorly likely feel otherwise with good reason.\r\n\r\n- Focus on the principles, not the details. C, C++, Unix and TCP/IP all have a really deep underlying logic and if you can wrap your head around it you're set. Everything is there for a reason. If you remember the reason you can derive the details on the exam. For example, in Unix and C \"everything is a file\" (external devices, actual files, other programs, etc.) so when you write to stdout you're writing \"to a file.\" When you read from stdin, you're reading \"from a file.\" Sockets can be treated exactly like a file. BUT because \"everything is a file,\" a \"pointer to a file\" (FILE *) can't possibly be an ordinary derefencable pointer -- dereferencing, after all, is the act of visiting a location in memory and reading some information out, which you can't conceivably do with a web socket -- so if you worked through that logic, you wouldn't make the mistake some people did of thinking that a file pointer can be dereferenced. So, principles, not details.\r\n\r\nIn general, I liked this class a lot, though a grading dispute on the final exam made me seriously question Professor Lee's judgment/command of the English language. However, given that I did not witness any other such problems, I'll be charitable and assume it was a truly isolated incident.",

      "review_text": "I took this class 1.5 times. I started as a sophomore, shortly after 1004, with the mindset of \"let me just make this program work.\" That mindset led me to a 50% by the time the withdrawal date came around (which would've been a B-, but I thought I was failing) so I withdrew.\r\n\r\nI enrolled in the class again 2 years later, this time with the programmatic maturity to understand what the class was really about, and why that information mattered. Although the classwork takes the format of programming assignments, they are really about the underpinnings about C/languages (e.g. memory management, pointers, etc.). If you want to learn it well, you should break things! Rewrite your labs in different notations (e.g. array vs. pointer) to learn the differences. Become intimate with C. \r\n\r\nThe reason I mention my backstory is to help advise students who are on the fence about taking the class now or later. Some people can handle AP early on. But two years ago I honestly didn't care about freeing memory or understanding where my variables were stored. I gradually developed that interest after taking a few more CS courses/ being asked such things in interviews, and I am very happy I had the opportunity to take AP again. I got a lot more out of it, and the class was immensely more interesting.  \r\n\r\nThe class has 10 labs, of which 1 (lab 8) is optional. In the past, Jae had a policy of only granting class-wide extensions and every lab would be extended. He has changed his policy, for the better, to allot everyone 7 penalty-free late days each, to be used whenever (with a max of 2 late days for a given lab). This is a great policy, since it allows you to manage your time a lot better.\r\n\r\nThe class also has 2 midterms and a final. The all-or-nothing nature of many of the questions means the grades are relatively polarized--you could do extremely well or extremely poorly, for missing 1 simple thing. If you get above a 90, you really know what's up.\r\n\r\nSo I mostly wrote this review to call out the author of the last post (December 2013) regarding handling of the final. To give readers some context, several people in the class missed 5 points of a 20-point question for different reasons and proceeded to somewhat aggressively mail the list-serve arguing over which wrong answer was \"less wrong\" and deserved 2 extra points. Several TAs and Jae explained the reasoning to the rubric in response. \r\n\r\nTo insult Professor Lee's English, when he so eloquently and rationally addressed each concern from the email chain in a class announcement, is incredibly rude and borderline racist. Full disclosure: I missed 10 points of the same problem for a different reason, and though I disagreed with the severity, I had the decency to not make personal attacks.\r\n\r\nThough I found grading in the class sometimes tough, and I did not do as well I as would've liked, I learned *a lot* and became a much better programmer. Much of this is due to Jae. He is one of the few people in the department devoted exclusively to his students. I have personally experienced how he uses student feedback to iterate on his teaching from semester to semester, in order to better serve his students. He organized a class hackathon this semester, complete with pizza, Insomnia cookies, and t-shirts, to help students connect on an informal level. He stayed there the whole time, until 5:30 am, making sure he chatted with everyone at least once before he ran off to take his son to soccer. He learned my name despite the large class size (I never attended office hours or anything either).  He is one of the best professors I have had in the department, and I would recommend taking his class to anyone mature enough (as a programmer/student/person) to handle it.",

If you go to every class and pay attention (which isn't too difficult to do), you'll learn a ton about C, C++, how the internet works, etc.\r\n\r\nThe material itself is quite difficult. C is a low-level language, so you'll be doing a lot of stuff that you probably never did before (especially in 1004/1007). You have to worry about memory, how pointers specifically work, and every other minuscule detail that gets done for you in higher-level languages like Java.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting that you start at C, but build up to C++, which shows itself to be strangely similar to Java (Java was built off of C++)... so you kind of do a full-circle.\r\n\r\nOverall, would absolutely recommend this class, but make sure you take it in a semester that you aren't too overloaded with other stuff.

      "review_text": "One of the better CS courses out there. It's truly inspirational how Jae teaches (Sidenote:  Chris Mulligan and Jonathan Balsano, the head TA's are also a plus for this course; they know everything and they will go the extra mile to make sure you know the way Jae wants you to know the material). The labs get progressively harder (lab 2 is particularly challenging for those that only know Java and thinks they know everything).\r\n\r\nJae hands out a bunch of very clear yet brief set notes for every topics. The listserv is very useful and you won't have to wait more than a couple of hours before a TA responds to your questions.\r\n\r\nThe bad part are the exams. For all the thought Jae puts into the labs and lectures, I feel he hasn't figured out a way of writing exams that aren't so unforgiving yet as challenging as the ones he cooks up. No matter how many hours you spend studying for the exams, you will be challenged. There are no easy questions. You almost certainly will need to go through an overly-complicated program that makes you follow 10-15 logical statements that intersect and go through overly-complicated loops. Almost always the questions will be either right or wrong, and there aren't many questions (usually 10 in midterms, 20 in final). Normally this wouldn't be such a problem, but each question usually tests for 3, 4 or 5 things at the same time. So even if you knew everything there is to know about 4 concepts, if you missed the one, you won't get the answer right (guessing here is really, REALLY bad) and you will probably end up losing a bunch of points. His exams are all or nothing, meaning that you won't get partial credit over anything. You truly are as strong as your weakest topic.\r\n\r\nThen again, if you want to be a programmer or you want to do something related to programming later on, take this course. You will learn more in 3 months than you could expect in a year. If you are not a programmer, nevertheless take this course.

      "review_text": "So Jae taught this course in Spring 2014 because the normal OS professor was on leave. I'm not sure when he will teach the course again, but I wanted there to be a CULPA review so that people can go into this well-informed.\r\n\r\n--- The Course ---\r\nI learned a ton from this course, though I didn't necessarily realize it as I was slogging through. Jae reformatted the course and taught it with undergrads in mind, which was appropriate given that the class had many more undergrads than in past years (no doubt because of Jae's popularity). As such, much of the first half was actually an extension of AP (lab7/http-server) used to teach OS concepts such as concurrency, memory sharing, and inter-process communication (user space programs to teach kernel stuff). It again demonstrates Jae's theory of teaching, using previous knowledge in order to bridge the gap to new concepts. With regard to content, Jae put a great deal of time into UNIX programming compared with hardware knowledge / kernel hacking. Jae explains that the earlier stuff is more applicable and the latter stuff is changing (e.g. we didn't cover hard disks, probably because SSDs sort of shift that paradigm). I buy his explanation. The pacing of the course wasn't great, with probably too much time spent on UNIX programming on the front and too little systems/kernel work at the end. Of course, this is understandable given that this was Jae's first time teaching OS and that he completely restructured it.\r\n\r\n--- Homework ---\r\nA few individual assignments (that are pretty easy) with mostly group projects (up to groups of three). Having a good group is obviously helpful. All the projects run on Arch Linux, which you will set up on VirtualBox. The assignments usually didn't involve much coding, but rather a lot of understanding how the code runs and scouring the internet. In other words, frustrating yet also good practice for the real world. The assignments have good underlying structure, but still need refining (again, should get better over time). Sidenote: the listserv from AP carries over as well, and will save you hours of struggle if you follow closely.\r\n\r\n--- Exams ---\r\nI got destroyed on the midterm, but in hindsight it was one of the best crafted CS exams I have ever seen. It definitely tested your ability to read code and apply the concepts we learned. The final was very different and a bad evaluation of our mastery in my opinion: 25 multiple choice questions about very specific things we covered (i.e. very un-Jae-like). Both exams unfortunately do not provide room for partial credit.\r\n\r\n--- Lectures ---\r\nNot incredibly interesting, but still important to really ingrain the material in your head. Jae mostly worked off of powerpoints, which I found ineffective. The few times he used the board were better. For me, printing the notes/slides beforehand and taking notes directly on them worked best.\r\n\r\n--- Grading ---\r\nJae curved to a high B+, which I consider pretty generous. Just be very VERY careful to follow homework instructions exactly as stated. Lots of times grading occurs on scripts, so the slightest problem could send your grade down just for not properly following basic instructions.\r\n\r\n--- TAs --- \r\nJae carried over the best AP TAs and I assume he would do so in the future as well. There was also a contingent of Chinese grad student TAs who were friendly, but generally less helpful.\r\n\r\nI doubt I've covered everything, but hopefully someone after me can fill in any missing gaps. On the whole, I would say to take the class with Jae if you are an undergrad (and if he ever teaches it again).",

Going to class won't help, and asking the TAs won't help. All you can really do is beat your head against your keyboard for hours on end until a mostly-functioning program comes out. Don't even think about asking your classmates for help; late in the course several people were picked out to complete a special assignment as punishment for cheating.\r\n\r\nHow are the exams? For the midterm he gives you 12 trick multiple choice questions about the fine details of MATLAB syntax followed by 3 pieces of code to correct. The code correction is generally straightforward, but good luck knowing how well you did on the rest!\r\n\r\nThe real tragedy here is that Paul Blaer is the other instructor for this course. Avoid any non-Blaer instructors at all costs, at least for this class. You'll save yourself many a headache.",

This would make sense if the homeworks were doable alone, and didn't incorporate higher level comp sci topics like recursion and GUI that no other computer science teacher covers in an intro course (for non-cs majors!!!).\r\n\r\nUltimately, this may possibly be the most horrible experience ever at Columbia with a professor (not friendly and gives terse replies to emails). Avoid him at all costs or prepare to suffer like never before. Very mentally draining and the only salvation is when the course finally ends (but not everybody can make it to the finish line unscathed).

      "review_text": "Prof. Pe'er is really well-intentioned, and it's clear that he cares a lot about his students. I took a lot away from this class, even though it was a struggle. That said, DO NOT take this class if you're not remotely interested in machine learning - it's _not_ worth it. There are several other breadth/AI track courses that are (possibly) more interesting. If you _are_ interested in the subject, however, I'd definitely recommend taking this class with him instead of with Prof. Jebara. \r\n\r\n1) Teaching: If you have trouble staying awake in classes where professors speak really slowly/if you've ever been in one of the Mudd classrooms and know how boring they are, BRING COFFEE/TEA/anything that keeps you awake. Prof. Pe'er speaks really slowly, so much so that when you play his lectures at 1.5x speeds (they're all on CVN, which is great), it sounds like most people speaking at a normal pace. \r\n2) The material: While the class is very math-heavy (as are most courses on machine learning), Prof. Pe'er is very generous with his use of examples to provide better intuitions for the concepts/algorithms covered, and even tries to do live demonstrations to help make the math clearer. Some lectures and topics have a very steep learning curve even if you have the prerequisites covered, but I learned a tremendous amount from this class and I don't think I would have gotten that much from Prof. Jebara's far more theoretical approach. \r\n3) Homework: The homework is time consuming, not because each individual assignment is long, but because there are assignments EVERY WEEK. The assignments are hard, so starting in advance is essential (which means you're usually working on ML assignments 4 days a week at least), and responses on Piazza from the TAs are erratic and come in waves, so they're not reliable. Prof. Pe'er does allow group work with some constraints, so that usually makes working on assignments easier. But START EARLY. The assignments are also usually vaguely worded, which was a pain to deal with.\r\n4) The tests: This was the most confusing part of the class. I think Prof. Pe'er experimented with a lot of testing styles because it was his first time teaching this class. (Either that, or he always throws 4 different testing styles at his students in all his other classes too because he thinks it builds character.) \r\n- Quizzes: multiple choice, where any number of choices could be true or false, and you lost points for either answering wrong or not answering at all. (So really, you had a 50% chance of getting it right anyway..) The questions on the quiz were theoretical and just requierd you to know the concepts, and some involved doing some basic calculations/inferences.\r\n- Midterm: Easily the best test in this class. It was take-home and entirely programming, with 50% of the grade going towards an explanation of your approach. I think the grading was pretty fair - you got graded on the performance of your approach for the programming part, and the quality of your approach for the explanation. Very straightforward and doable in the 4 day timeframe given.\r\n- Final: This came out of nowhere - the questions on the final ranged from proofs to algorithm creation to calculations - basically a very, very difficult exam. He gave us a practice final that, as it turned out, exactly resembled the actual final, but it still gave us no way to prepare, given that all the testing methods we'd had before were so different. It was almost impossibly long (though challenging and very interesting, required you to actually apply knowledge to real-world problems).\r\n\r\n5) The curve: VERY generous curve. Another reason to definitely take this class with him and not Prof. Jebara. I think he really recognizes how hard he makes the class (in terms of workload, learning curve, difficulty of final) and curves to a high-ish B+. A large percentage of the class got A-range grades. \r\n\r\nAgain, this is a professor who really cares about his students and the effort they put in, and isn't just looking to make this class frustrating and impossible. In general, he's very very responsive to feedback, even takes reasonable requests for class-wide extensions, and always tries really hard to make sure ever single student understands. I haven't had many 4000-level classes where that's the case, so this was refreshing. The class is still extremely frustrating, but ultimately rewarding if you like the material and put a lot of effort into the work.",

He is by far the worst professor I've ever had in my academic experience. To add insult to injury, he is very unapologetic about the way he manages things and treats his students unfairly. \r\n\r\nAssignments:\r\nEvery assignment included grammatical errors and unintelligible sentences in addition to mistakes in the problem descriptions. As a result, 1-2 day assignment would turn into a week-long affair. Future assignments are also based on answers to previous ones even though the class was not given the solution to the previous assignment. As a result, students who might have had incorrect answers in the previous assignment would unknowingly have errors in the next assignment.\r\n\r\nMisinformation:\r\nProfessor Pe'er likes to portray himself as a fair individual but time and time again did he prove us wrong. Our first quiz was multiple choice test where correct answers were given 3 points and incorrect negative 2. However, the class was not told that leaving answers blank would result in negative marks too. Another example of this kind of behavior was demonstrated when he ran a poll to decide whether assignments should be due on a Friday or Wednesday. >80% of students who voted, voted for Friday yet the Professor appeared to have conveniently forgotten to tell the class that over 60% of the entire class needed to participate in the poll for it to be deemed valid. Something he decided to tell us after the fact. \r\n\r\nSadly there are many more examples of this kind of behavior which is simply unprofessional. \r\n\r\nI can't speak to how Prof Jebara might teach this class and whether it's any better. But my main advice would be to stay away from Prof Pe'er, simply because you'll waste more time clearing up any confusions than being able to dedicate time to the actual subject.\r\n\r\n ",

The first half covers digital design and the second covers computer architecture involving learning elementary programming in MIPS assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Good: \r\nMartha Kim is friendly, approachable and helpful. She willingly answers questions in class and for the most part she answers them well - especially when it comes to the computer architecture, she knows her stuff well. She teaches from slides, and what's in the slides is pretty much what you're going to be expected to know for the class. The slides are easy to read and understand and have intuitive diagrams. A lot of the pictures are taken from the textbook. I found the course material interesting and valuable.\r\n\r\nWhat was wanting:\r\nThe lectures were mostly very boring. She spent a lot of time explaining trivial things that we could have understood better and more quickly by glancing over the slides on our own time. Most of the lecture was spent in teaching relatively straightforward concepts but almost no time was spent teaching us to apply them. In other words we did almost no real problems-solving or \"thinking\" in class. Any examples covered, were for the most part trivial ones. As a result, there was a gap between the lectures and homeworks and an even bigger one between the lectures and the exams. The lectures certainly prepared us very poorly for the midterm on which the mean was a 52 and which was so long that almost no one actually finished.\r\n\r\n6 homeworks in the semester, one assigned every two weeks, about 4 questions per homework. Given that we had two weeks between hwks, it was really very little work. I spent an average of 4-5 hours on each assignment, only about 2 of the questions out of 4 actually required thinking, although these ones could be tricky. The problem was that we didn't have enough of these questions and didn't have enough homeworks so when the midterm rolled around, we got killed.\r\n\r\nThe final was non-cumulative and included everything from after the midterm. It was about the same length as the midterm but we had double the time so it was manageable. The mean was 63 - I got a 92. I recommend reading the slides and textbook very carefully. You need to have a complete understanding of the single-cycle and pipelined processors - especially the pipelined one and also get some practice coding in assembly.\r\n\r\n",

What I mean is that you wont learn anything great here except simple synchronizations mechanisms, which if you do 1 or 2 good problems, you can learn.\r\n\r\n2) Whole purpose of \"Vijay Saraswat' and IBM crap to teach this course is to get their language i.e. X10(that you are suppose to struggle to learn in this course) their research project @IBM famous in academia. NOTHING ELSE. There is not even documentation worthwhile reading for X10.\r\n\r\n3) They have no clue how to teach, but SEAS department is really dumb fuck department that allows such courses to happen even when intentions are very clear of parties involved in teaching.\r\n\r\n4)Martha kim is highly incompetent teacher. Her job in lecture hours will be just to sit back and reply to emails on her Mac. Once a while she would turn up to do announcements, afterall Columbia pays her for teaching.Really is that what she is required/supposed to do?\r\n\r\n5) Vijay Saraswat's bubble is to let people try 'TRICKY' problems and they will learn rather give tricky problems in quizzes or exams. Asshole, if that is what is required to be done, why are you in class and even taking this course. Is that how a course is supposed to be taught.\r\n\r\n6)I should say first Vijay and Martha should learn how to teach, take this course elsewhere say GaTech and then think about teaching.Assholes I just wasted my tuition hoping that I would learn something great. SHIT \r\n\r\nSeriously, I just feel so sad that Columbia being Ivy league could allow such cheap bastards to teach and even after complaints last year nothing was done ever to improve, except to remove exams from  course.\r\n\r\nNot worthy course to waste your tuition on.",

      "review_text": "Martha Kim is fantastic for several reasons:\r\n\r\n1) She is a VERY clear lecturer; she teaches directly from slides that on their own are very descriptive, and goes through them at a pace that is easy to follow. She is extremely eloquent and obviously very knowledgeable about the subject material, so it's really easy to follow and engage with what she's saying; she's not one of those awful lecturers who you have to really actively try to pay attention to for the whole class. She intentionally goes over slides with diagrams a little longer than other slides so that students who like to take notes have time to copy them down. There was one day when she had to rush through how Karnaugh maps worked, and in the next class she apologized for the lack of clarity and spent probably the first third of that class re-explaining them and really making sure everyone understood what was going on. If you go to class (and are at all awake/paying any amount of attention to her) you will understand the material. Point of the story: her lecture style is succinct and easy to follow and if you pay attention in class she will teach you the material.\r\n\r\n2) It seems like she really genuinely wants everyone to succeed. She holds more office hours than any other compsci professor I've had and every time I've gone she is really approachable and has seemed genuinely concerned about making sure I am not confused about anything (not to mention she's just super nice). She assigns a very reasonable amount of work because she doesn't want the class to be a source of unnecessary anxiety for students. That being said, the assignments are challenging enough that they definitely do make you learn the material to do them (which I think is a good thing). This is not an easy A class. You will have to do work. But she actually wants you to do well at it, which is definitely not true for every professor at Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe only bad thing I have to say about the class is that the problem set grading has been a little haphazard - on the first assignment, the grading was really harsh, which a lot of students made a big fuss about; then on the next assignment, the grading seemed really easy. But this discrepancy in grading tolerance seems to stem from the TAs more than Martha Kim. \r\n\r\nOverall, she is very intelligent and also very nice and I think she's been a fantastic instructor for Fundamentals!",

I appreciated her approach to midterms and homeworks - there is always ample material to help aid your studying, and she and the TAs are very responsive via email. She leaves a day to review before the midterm, and we could send in questions to help direct the midterm review session. \r\n\r\nGrading seems very fair, and solutions are explained in class when we receive our homeworks back. \r\n\r\nThe material is nothing incredibly exciting, but Prof. Kim does a good job breaking it down into understandable chunks so that it's not too overwhelming at once. \r\n\r\nThe midterm was an accurate assessment of what we were learning in class, and the average was something around a 76 I believe, with many people scoring in the 80 and 90 ranges. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is no required textbook, and she only expects you to know what she covers in the slides, which was a relief when studying for the midterm.\r\n\r\nOverall, solid class.

(Her slide sets are like finely aged wine.)\r\n\r\nShe gives eminently reasonable problem sets and tests (1 midterm, 1 final, noncumulative) and once got off an airplane to fix a glitch in her website that students needed to access for a problem set.\r\n\r\nShe also had a great sense of style, is genuinely and adorably amused by things like slow processors, and will explain things for you in multiple different ways until you get it.

A further example is that when she found out that her final letter grade script had a bug in it, she sent personal emails to anyone who contacted her about it (within 24 hours on top of that) and promptly fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nWith regards to her teaching, I would say that she is not quite on par with Adam Cannon or Jae yet. However, in looking at her previous reviews and comparing it with my experience with her this semester, it appears that she has improved a good amount. My guess is that if she keeps refining her teaching skill, she can eventually teach at that level.\r\n\r\nOne thing that others have not mentioned is that you will be programming in MIPS Assembly Language for one of the psets. My suggestion would be to take AP (3157) before or at the same time as this course (I did the latter) since AP really gets you thinking in terms of lower level computing, which makes the assignment much easier. On the whole, AP and Fundamentals really seem to complement one another, so try to get AP in first or at the same time.",

Professor Kim is a good lecturer and really good at explaining tricky concepts to the greener students.\r\n\r\nIf the class hadn't been at 10 AM (waaaay too early for this senior) I would've gone more often and likely gotten a lot out of it. When I did go, Professor Kim would mention neat factoids not covered on exams but still good to know, like (my favorite): Intel kept adding more stages to its pipeline in the '90s so it could ramp up its clock speed, and had to change its advertising strategy to deemphasize clock speed when it turned out fewer stages was optimal and clock speeds decelerated as a result.",

I would say Xi's a bit better than \"not bad\".\r\n\r\nTypically, classes like Algorithms go really fast, leaving most students lost and confused. Xi is good in this sense because he teaches at a slower pace so it's easier to understand the long proofs and sometimes dense material. The drawback of his speed is that we didn't finish the syllabus. We missed 2 classes because of snow days and another 3 classes because Xi was overly ambitious to cover so much material at his teaching pace. He also posts excellent slides online so you don't have to worry if you missed something in class.\r\n\r\nThe class itself is pretty hard. The book CLRS, while excellent, is quite dense and detailed. Homework was almost completely assigned from the exercises in the book, which are nearly impossible the solve. The HW averages were pretty high (around 55/60). This is because solutions to problems from CLRS are available online if you search carefully enough. I highly recommend you don't do this since you will get screwed come exam time. Xi is super helpful in Office Hours and you should go to him if you get stuck on HW (because you will, trust me). He will walk you through any problem and give you an outline of the solution. Sometimes, the problems are so hard, that Xi himself can't solve them on the spot (not knocking on Xi; he's really smart. I'm just saying the problems are that difficult). \r\n\r\nThe midterm was much easier than the problem sets, but still far from easy. One question on perfect hashing which worth 20 points could be solved only if you remembered a proof from his lecture slides. Most people didn't get it, so remember to read his slides thoroughly. Grading was fair, maybe a bit strict.\r\n\r\nFinal was similar to the midterm in difficulty and was a bit longer, but you had 3 hours which was plenty of time. I thought the final was easier, but I ended up getting a lower score on it than the midterm, so I don't know what to make of it.\r\n\r\nThe class had roughly 8 undergrads out of a 100 students, so be prepared to be lonely. There are PhD students in this class, so don't expect to ace it, though getting an A shouldn't be a problem if you put the effort into this class. I'm not sure if he curves undergrads separately.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a good class. You will learn a lot and become much better at constructing solid proofs and thinking algorithmically. I think Xi is just as good as Stein, so feel free to take this class with him.",
